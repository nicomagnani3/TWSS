            "reviewBody": "My Review Baz Lurhmann&apos;s - Elvis\n\nMy Rating 7.5 /10\n\n10/10 for Austin Butler&apos;s portrayal as Elvis\n\nElvis has the Baz Lurhmann brand all over it as it&apos;s bound to seeing Baz wrote the story as well as Directed and Produced the movie . Whether that&apos;s a good thing or not I&apos;m not so sure but top marks for his choice of Austin Butler to play the title role of Elvis Presley.\n\nAustin Butler had big shoes to fill and Elvis fans won&apos;t be disappointed as he portrays the iconic singer over more than 20 years of his life covering the 50s, 60s, and 70s, eras from his childhood and meteoric rise to stardom to his long, slow decline.\n\nThis biographical movie unlike the 2019 movie Judy I&apos;m pleased to say covers the good years as well as the sad years when Elvis left us tragically aged only 42 under identical circumstances to Judy Garland who was 47.\n\nBoth stars burnt out prematurely both were exploited but their fame and legacy of music and film footage will live on for centuries as they are both true historical cultural icons.\n\nAustin Butler really does hold the entire movie together for me he gives much more than an Elvis impersonation which so many performers have done before.\n\nAt times and at certain camera angles Austin Butler looks uncannily identical to Elvis Presley and he sings the early Elvis songbook in his own voice to perfection. Austin&apos;s voice is only blended with Elvis&apos;s own voice in the later Las Vegas years .\n\nMany other actors in addition to Austin Butler auditioned for the role including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles but the right choice to play Elvis certainly was Austin Butler in my opinion.\n\nUnlike Rami Malik who played Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and had the Freddie Mercury teeth he wore cast in gold , Austin Butler&apos;s transformation really just relies on eye make up ,hairstyle and the tight pants and flamboyant shirts and capes that Elvis wore during his performances.\n\nI&apos;m certain Austin Butler&apos;s performance is what prompted the Elvis movie to receive a 12 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Rami Malik received an Oscar and lip synched the songs so Austin Butler who sings in his own voice should at least get a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2023.\n\nThere were positives I liked in Baz Luhrmann&apos;s Elvis and negatives as much as I admire Tom Hanks as an Actor the role of Colonel Tom Parker who is the storyteller through whose eyes we see the rise and fall of The King of Rock is a despicable and ugly character . While of course he is a central character in the Elvis Presley story I felt telling the story through such an unsympathetic character was unnecessary and I found Tom Hanks Dutch accent and his prosthetic nose a little irritating at times.\n\nThe Cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning as are the costumes by Baz Luhrmann&apos;s 4 time Academy Award winning wife Catherine Martin .\n\nAll biography movies stretch or modify the facts to a certain extent to add more dramatic content and while this story is reasonably accurate Baz has used some poetic licence in some scenes . The emotional meeting of Elvis and the Producer Steve Binder of his 1968 Christmas comeback show at the iconic rusting L. A. Hollywood sign never happened but it&apos;s effective.\n\nThe opening introduction scene of Colonel Tom Parker discovering Elvis at the Carnival which I&apos;m sure was inspired by Guillermo del Toro&apos;s recent movie Nightmare Alley also never occurred. World events of that time are used as a timeline like the assassination of Bobby Kennedy during taping of an Elvis television show also are fiction but it does add drama to the script.\n\nThere&apos;s also a silly hysterical scene where an entire Christmas snow set is built to convince The Colonel that Elvis was going to sing Here Comes Santa Claus in his 1968 comeback show this also apparently was a complete fiction as was the fact that Elvis was persuaded by Parker to enlist in the army rather than being arrested for his suggestive stage gyrations. Elvis did not enlist he was drafted and surrounded by the media when he entered the Army in March 1958.\n\nThose who love Showman Baz Luhrmann&apos;s flamboyant highly individual directing style I&apos;m sure will love Elvis I enjoyed it but didn&apos;t love it.\n\nThe supporting cast that includes Olivia De Jonge as Pricilla Richard Roxburgh as Vernon Presley Helen Thomson as Gladys and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jimmie Rodgers Snow are all good but in my view could have been featured more .\n\nI personally think he lacks subtlety and while putting on a great show his script in this case focuses to much on the character of Colonel Tom Parker and as I recently referred to heroes as main characters in stories Colonel Tom Parker was no hero. Colonel Tom reminds me more of Rumpelstiltskin in more ways than one Elvis turned the straw that Colonel Tom Parker gave him into gold and like the Princess in the Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tale sadly Elvis paid a very high price.",

After seeing a couple dozens now, the writing is just taking a nose dive, especially in this one.\n\nThere is not one memorable line or a joke or something in this movie. Its even emotionally dull and boring. You know pretty much what will happen form the start. The writing is lazy at best and for a 200 million dollar poduction or whatever it was its actually scandolously bad. I&apos;m surprised the actors are not bored out of their minds with these kinda stupid dialogs.\n\nThe good you would ask? Spectactular CGI... and i mean really award winning type of stuff. The rest...belongs where your toilet is.\n\nIts the same thing boiled up over and over like your last bad of green tea.",

I was dubious about writing a comment, seeing as it really has been ages since it was released and thinking that most people who wanted to see it probably already have. After recently watching it for the umpteenth time on TV, I felt compelled to write a quickie ;) I have to say, it&apos;s the first time I looked up Top Gun on the imdb and I was actually quite surprised that it only received a 6.4 rating. If you haven&apos;t seen the movie yet, don&apos;t judge it by the ratings, read a few user comments first and just rent it out, I guarantee you&apos;ll have a good time, especially with its amazing soundtrack! The best 80&apos;s songs ever written, I still get chills down my back listening to them ;) It&apos;s a simple plot but there&apos;s something about it that makes it a seriously enjoyable film and one you can watch time and time again. Go have fun! Enjoy!"

            "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn&apos;t the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50&apos;s plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70&apos;s.  A lot of critics don&apos;t like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don&apos;t care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like &quot;The Two Towers&quot; where it doesn&apos;t feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn&apos;t as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50&apos;s science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70&apos;s disaster flick.  If you don&apos;t care for either of these genres you probably won&apos;t like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don&apos;t take it too seriously and have fun watching it.",

It&apos;s #2 on IMDb&apos;s Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what&apos;s one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it&apos;s time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn&apos;t watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it&apos;s 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I&apos;ll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it&apos;s violent and nasty in spots--but it&apos;s also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it&apos;s received.\n\nMy advice is that instead of just watching &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Godfather: Part II&quot;, see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",

When people constantly seem to be shocked at his range I tell them to go back and watch reign over me. He&apos;s always had this versatility. That&apos;s not to say his signature brand of comedy isn&apos;t implemented in this solid film. The story is rather straightforward an interesting as it also shows his passion for the game of basketball that he&apos;s always had in reality as well. Overall another solid entry into his recent renaissance. Wasn&apos;t too fond of certain moments or the casting of Latifah as his wife but I can look that over.",

It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.\n\nThis isn&apos;t your usual comic book movie, it&apos;s a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said &quot;This is a masterpiece&quot; everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.\n\nOf the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.\n\nOn the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;d cut), and I really wasn&apos;t keen on the ending (I don&apos;t know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It&apos;s here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!\n\nI was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.",

            "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. I&apos;ve never purchased or owned anything Gucci, but that didn&apos;t prevent me from enjoying the heck out of Ridley Scott&apos;s film that brings the longest, most expensive and dangerous real life episode of &apos;Family Feud&apos; to the big screen. It&apos;s co-written by Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna, and is based on the 2001 book, &quot;House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed&quot; by Sara Gay Forden. Brace yourself for a (mostly) true wild ride, and for what is likely to be one of the year&apos;s most divisive films - plenty of love and hate (just like the actual story).\n\nWhat happens when a brand is so closely associated with a family name? The arguments begin on who &apos;deserves&apos; to be a Gucci, who is a &apos;real&apos; Gucci, and who should make the decisions that impact the Gucci family and business wealth and reputation. During the extended run time (2 hours, 37 minutes), we see many of the iconic Gucci items: the Flora scarf, the moccasins, the bamboo bag, and the watches. And though high fashion is always present, director Scott has delivered a spectacle of romance, family riffs, extravagance, greed, power, betrayal, revenge, and crime.\n\nLady Gaga (Oscar winner, A STAR IS BORN, 2018) stars as Patrizia, the newest Gucci. Hers is not blind ambition, but rather calculated and laser-focused. That she implodes a dysfunctional family is only a portion of the story. After marrying Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), Patrizia immediately begins manipulating her husband into reconciling with his family and taking on an active role in a business for which he previously had little interest. This is simply step two (the first was marriage) in her grand scheme to control the business and the money. Maurizio&apos;s father Rodolfo (Oscar winner Jeremy Irons, REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, 1990) is ailing, so it&apos;s Uncle Aldo (Oscar winner Al Pacino, SCENT OF A WOMAN, 1992) to whom Patrizia directs her attention. She plays it like a chess match - only this is more entertaining to watch unfold.\n\nAlso in the picture is Paolo Gucci (a truly unrecognizable Jared Leto, Oscar winner, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB), Aldo&apos;s son, and a family outcast. Paolo is a wildly creative individual who tends to his pet pigeons and tries desperately to find his place in the family. Jack Huston plays Dominico De Sole, Rodolfo&apos;s consigliere and the family attorney. Each of the characters is given their time in the spotlight, including a terrific breakfast scene with Pacino and Irons. Of course this is mostly Patrizia&apos;s story, so it&apos;s Lady Gaga&apos;s performance that will attract much of the attention and commentary. I found her mesmerizing and twisted fun to watch as she proceeded with backstabbing and trickery. Driver&apos;s quietly intense approach makes the perfect contrast to hers.\n\nIf you are familiar with the story, you know that Maurizio does eventually run the company, and he also tires of Patrizia&apos;s family-crushing antics ... which send him back into the arms of Paola Franchi (Camile Cottin, STILLWATER, 2021). This turns the campy and juicy melodrama factor up to 11 (on the Spinal Tap scale). Patrizia&apos;s frequent trips to fortune teller and TV psychic Pina Auriemma (Salma Hayek) cause a massive tonal shift in the film, leading to the well-documented conclusion. If all this isn&apos;t strange enough, Ms. Hayek is the real-life spouse of the CEO of Gucci&apos;s present-day parent company, Kering. Reeve Carney (&quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;) has a small, yet vital role as up-and-coming fashion designer Tom Ford.\n\nIn this movie, it&apos;s easy to describe some performances as hammy or over-the-top, but that&apos;s likely to only hold as a first reaction. Leto&apos;s characterization of Paolo sticks out so much from the others ... but he was known as eccentric, and at best, was patronized by the family. It seems highly likely that his personality and approach stood in stark contrast to the old-school style of his father Aldo, or the more staid personalities of his Uncle Rodolfo and cousin Maurizio. Lady Gaga as Patrizia is cunning and shrewd in her calculated approach to re-structure the family and the business. She plays whatever games she must to get where she wants to be. I found her first half performance to be truly outstanding. Pacino is the actor who has trademarked hammy performances over the years, yet here, he fully grasps his role and character, and is a delight to watch.\n\nMuch of this is documented by history, though the Gucci family claims not all is or was how it seems. Whether the boost in counterfeiting/knock-offs went down in the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s as it&apos;s portrayed here, might be an area worth researching, but this is much less a case study in business principles as it is one in family dynamics. I&apos;ll certainly understand those who argue against the story structure here, but the entertainment value proved to be enough for me. As the Gucci tagline goes, &quot;Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten&quot;, but the backstabbing and disloyalty is never forgotten - despite providing great theater (and fashion).\n\nOpens in theaters on November 24, 2021.",

But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.\n\nWith surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.\n\nNo Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.\n\nNo Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend. Especially to the Marvel fans like me that had gotten bored of the new stuff.",

It felt great to lose myself into the feel of the wizarding world again. But the plot and the writing felt unanchored in anything real or relatable. Nothing felt earned. Events just happened without much anticipation or appreciation of their significance, and I didn&apos;t feel invested much in any of the plot lines or characters. I&apos;m not expert enough to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but I know something did.",

A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn&apos;t.\n\nI gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn&apos;t long enough for me. I would like to see a director&apos;s cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.\n\nI had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I&apos;ll never forget."

            "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. It&apos;s not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that&apos;s because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, &quot;The best stories are rooted in reality.&quot;\n\nOscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a &apos;wink and a nod&apos; to Fabio). Loretta&apos;s love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she&apos;s required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.\n\nAfter their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He&apos;s read her latest book and needs her help in locating the &apos;Crown of Fire&apos; hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he&apos;s more than a pretty face. Loretta&apos;s stressed out literary agent Beth (Da&apos;Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).\n\nIt&apos;s regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt&apos;s cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta&apos;s rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It&apos;s mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (&quot;The Office&quot;).\n\nSandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It&apos;s an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It&apos;s meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It&apos;s totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.\n\nOpening in theaters on March 25, 2022.",

            "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.\n\nAllan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don&apos;t know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....\n\nDirected by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can&apos;t act, getting terrified by monsters that don&apos;t really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.\n\nFrom beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.\n\nThe magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don&apos;t like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the &quot;life will find a way&quot; speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.\n\nAbsolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.\n\n10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)"

Some of these sequences were so anxiety-inducing, even when our lead is just walking down the street I couldn&apos;t help but tense up.\n\nMy only main disappointment was the ending. While it was building towards a satisfying conclusion, it just ends abruptly. I wanted more from it. But maybe that just shows how well everything was before hand. Also some awkward dialogue but that&apos;s just me nitpicking, it&apos;s not that big of a deal.\n\nOverall, while I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll just check this one out again, I had a good time with it and I&apos;m excited to see what else the director while be making next!",

The actors are frequently over-the-top, sometimes reaching cartoonish territory.\n\nOverall, this movie is not put together very well.

I should&apos;ve known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.\n\nChris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become mega-marquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I&apos;ve read, Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so, they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these long-time Marvel greats proud. Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare."

            "reviewBody": "Well, oddly enough then I actually never have played the games, but I am well familiar with them and the concept that is &quot;Uncharted&quot;. So I sort of knew what I was in for here, as I sat down to watch the 2022 movie &quot;Uncharted&quot; from writers Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, Amy Hennig, Jon Hanley Rosenberg, Matt Holloway and Mark D. Walker.\n\nAnd just as expected, then director Ruben Fleischer definitely delivered a wholesome and spot on action adventure that delivers a fast-paced adventure that will make the boy-that-never-wants-to-grow-up-in-us-all more than happy. The storyline in &quot;Uncharted&quot; was a great mixture of fast-paced action, great adventure much in the likes of &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, treasure hunting and good characters. So yeah, chances are great that there is something for just about everyone in the audience here.\n\nThe movie stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, whom actually carries the movie quite well together. But the movie also have the likes of Antonio Banderas, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle and Steven Waddington on the cast list.\n\nI was more than genuinely entertained by this action adventure, and it certainly is a franchise that could spawn more movies to sequel this one. I had heard some reviewer mention that &quot;Uncharted&quot; was just a popcorn munchin movie that required no thinking of any kind. But I found &quot;Uncharted&quot; to be more than just a lean-back-and-munch-on-the-popcorn type of movie, luckily. If you enjoyed the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies, then you will certainly also enjoy &quot;Uncharted&quot;.\n\nAs for realism, well just neatly wrap that notion in a small wrapping and place it on the shelf for the nearly two hours that &quot;Uncharted&quot; plays. This movie is all about entertainment, surprise, surprise.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Uncharted&quot; lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

They find a villain called Scarlet Overkill, and the minions are tasked with stealing the crown from the Queen.\n\nI saw the trailer and I thought the &quot;Minions&quot; was so cute. After watching the film, I thought it was even cuter than I expected! The plot is silly but fun. The minions are simple in design, and simple in their thoughts, but they manage to create the funniest situations. There are some jokes that made me laugh out loud, such as the usage of a teapot inside a police car. I also just realised that the minions are not talking unintelligible gibberish - it is actually a mix of languages, which I spotted Spanish, German, Mandarin and Bahasa. I enjoyed watching this animation, it is 90 minutes of brain-off entertainment."

It plays like one of the Christmas specials but more so, and combines an appropriately high stakes 19th century historical family mystery with an examination of an industry on the cusp of a revolution, as metaphor for Downton and the Crawleys doing their best to survive in a changing world. Hints are given how they will manage it.\n\nThis is not the place to start with Downton, and the movie assumes wise viewers know that. With so many characters, with so much history, the audience are given not so much introductions as little reminders.\n\nAs is traditional, Maggie Smith gets most of the best lines, but there are no weak performances. There&apos;s even a scattering of wisdom here and there among the drollery and drama.",

            "reviewBody": "Jaws (1975) **** (out of 4) \n\nSteven Spielberg&apos;s classic about a man-eating Great White shark stalking the beaches of Amity and the three men who go out to try and kill it. Seriously, is there anyone who doesn&apos;t know the plot to this masterpiece? \n\nConsidering all the production trouble on this thing it would be amazing to get a half-way decent film yet for some reason, perhaps the movie Gods were shining down, we ended up with one of the greatest films ever made. This is without question one of the greatest films to deal with tension as Spielberg masterfully handles all the material. The movie is like an amazing roller coaster as we get one scare after another until the end when we just get our senses attacked from all around. Millions of people have discussed the greatness of this film so it&apos;s hard to pick one thing but I&apos;d say the greatest achievement of the film is the simple adventure it gives us.\n\nEven though we get some very intense scenes the screenplay is smart enough to give us other things to go with. We got some nice black humor in the witty dialogue but we also get a good buddy picture with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss delivering memorable characters. The three of them together are so different yet all three are like people I&apos;m sure each viewer has met so it&apos;s easy to connect with them and it makes the film all the more fun when we go on this adventure.\n\nThe film, of course, benefits from the brilliant John Williams score, which is perhaps the most memorable in film history. Bruce, the name given to the shark, caused most of the problems during filming but you wouldn&apos;t know that by just watching the picture. The look of the shark is incredible and Spielberg certainly made the right decision of keeping it hidden and just revealing bits and pieces as the movie went along. The first glimpse in the pond is hauntingly shocking and each sighting just grows more and more tension. The director also knows how to build suspense without us seeing the shark as we&apos;re constantly viewing objects floating (the dock, the barrels) to imply that the creature is there.\n\nWhat&apos;s even more amazing is that this film scared people so badly that they refused to go into the water yet the most suspenseful scene is probably the now legendary speech by Shaw about his time on the USS Indianapolis. It goes without saying but the three leads are all terrific in their roles and I really can&apos;t think of too many movies that have as many memorable characters as the ones here. We also get strong supporting work from Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gary as Brody&apos;s wife.\n\nFor me this ranks as one of the greatest adventures ever captured on film because everyone involved makes it feel so real. When the men get on the boat to go after the shark you feel as if you&apos;re really there. When the camera is underwater given a POV shot of the shark, you feel as if you&apos;re in the water. The final death scene in the movie also just happens to be one of the most terrifying ever captured on film and it might even be the most brutal. The movie is a true masterpiece of suspense and I think it would be fair that nothing has come close to this in the past 35 years. Like PSYCHO, we&apos;ve had a lot of rips of imitations but nothing has come close to the same power and it&apos;s doubtful anything ever will."

            "reviewBody": "First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.\n\nI laughed, lots. I cried, lots. I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots I even punched the air in a &quot;go on!&quot; during one scene\n\nI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.\n\nMade by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.\n\nGo with it. Enjoy the ride.\n\nSoak up every second, it doesn&apos;t feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.\n\nI have nothing else to say.\n\n10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!\n\nFans! Assemble!",

            "reviewBody": "&apos;Goodfellas&apos; is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it&apos;s all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it&apos;s really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he&apos;s ever been, and this is Joe Pesci&apos;s definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the &quot;stars&quot;. (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). &apos;Goodfellas&apos; is (to date) Scorsese&apos;s last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!"

            "reviewBody": "It (2017) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nA small town has a strange history with various disasters that strike every twenty-seven years and more times than not it&apos;s children that are harmed. One summer a group of friends realize that they are all being stalked by the vision of a sinister clown known as Pennywise. They soon realize that if they don&apos;t try to kill it then he will kill them one by one.\n\nStephen King&apos;s IT was originally made for television in 1990 and it was a hugely successful film that scared the crap out of people. The film had all sorts of hype going into it and it actually lived up to it. The film carried on a cult following for years and then news broke that a new adaptation was coming. This film really try to create the same type of hype and it ended up being a massive box office hit. People were eating it up and it&apos;s easy to see why. With that said, as much as I loved certain parts of it there&apos;s no question that there are some major flaws as well.\n\nThe great stuff includes the drama aspect of the story. The real terror comes from the bullying, the girl&apos;s sexual abuse by her father, the blame you place on yourself for your brother&apos;s death and of course there&apos;s the building of friendships that kids do during the summer. All of this is perfectly done and director Andy Muschietti does a wonderful job with the development of the characters. He also does a terrific job at capturing the mood and setting of a small town. The 1988/89 settings were perfectly captured and you can sit there and feel that you&apos;re in a real town with real characters.\n\nAll of the performances by the kids are simply wonderful with Sophia Lillis and Jeremy Ray Taylor really standing out. The adult performances are just as great even though they&apos;re all basically small supporting roles. Tehn there&apos;s Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. I thought the actor was terrific in the park and I enjoyed how much more sinister this clown was. I also loved the line delivery and thought the actor was terrific at bringing this character to the screen.\n\nWith that said, there are some major, major flaws that pretty much kill the horror elements of the film and that&apos;s the CGI. The CGI effects are so fake looking that I couldn&apos;t help but be taken out of the drama that was going on. This isn&apos;t a Marvel movie or some sort of fantasy. Why build up the setting so much just to throw it all away with cheap effects? And I ask you this.... Was this CGI, fake looking clown that rushes towards the camera or floats around really as creepy as the actor and his make-up? Why they had to throw these cheap, fake looking effects is anyone&apos;s guess but it really hurts the film.\n\nOverall, I&apos;d say that the original was better but there&apos;s still a lot of great stuff here. It&apos;s really too bad that there really aren&apos;t any scares due to the fake looking effects and it&apos;s even worse that everything was there for a much better movie. As it stands, IT is good but not a classic."

But to my pleasant surprise, the movie composed itself with a lot of nuance on both ends of the argument to share its story without a strong bias on either side; something I very much appreciate. Pleasure is a very decent movie, but with very little originality in my opinion. Yes, I liked its tone overall, but the story plays out exactly the way you&apos;d think it would by the first 15 minutes. It certainly wasn&apos;t boring, but it never captivated as much as it had the potential to, and that&apos;s something I wish this movie could have done different.\n\nOverall however, it was a decent watch, but more importantly, it was made with the right frame of mind... and that&apos;s what truly stood out to me.",

It&apos;s introducing a swath of new superhero&apos;s and doesn&apos;t really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero&apos;s. That job on its own isn&apos;t an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it&apos;s just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn&apos;t take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I&apos;m not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",

            "reviewBody": "If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.\n\nFrank Darabont&apos;s (writing and directing) The Mist adapts a horror novella of the same name. King&apos;s horror work has been the most difficult material to adapt, but this film is comparable to other genre stand-outs such as The Shining and 1408.\n\nA brief, dramatic thunderstorm is followed by a freak mist that descends on a small New England town. As the mist permeates the town, people congregate in the local supermarket and hardware store to stock up and gather supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane), his son (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor (Andre Braugher) are among them. Tension builds as a steady stream of military vehicles pass through the mist headed south from a nearby base. But serious concern doesn&apos;t start until one of the locals runs to the supermarket with blood spatters on his clothing and talking of monsters in the mist.\n\nIndeed, there are horrors outside in the fog, but there are also horrors inside the market - as paranoia, irrationality and religion come into conflict with practical issues of survival.\n\nUnlike many horror films, The Mist examines fear and its effects realistically, looks at the horror created by forces beyond human control and the even more terrifying horror that fear creates through forces that are completely within our grasp - our own fears, our beliefs and our treatment of each other. It does so using a classic formula which is comparable to films like Night of the Living Dead and, more recently, Feast.\n\nThe cinematography, editing and directing are all excellent. The acting is quite good - Marcia Gay Harden and William Sadler stood out for me - and the script is exactly where it needed to be for this adaptation.\n\nHighly recommended for King fans and horror fans. Recommended for Sci-Fi fans. Weakly recommended for average cinema-goers who are not generally interested in horror.",

In short: desperately annoying. It&apos;s really an uninterrupted series of dismemberments, decapitation and eye-gouging delights during manifold battles against apocalyptic monsters. These scenes are strung together at a blistering pace for one disappointing purpose: make you forget an incoherent script full of moronic plot twists.

Not too many fight scenes, but when they happen, they&apos;re good! Kinda &apos;The Gambler&apos; meets &apos;The Equalizer&apos; movie. Milo Ventimiglia best known from Heroes as Peter Petrelli does a great job as the bad guy in this film. Wish he had more roles in mainstream movies. Not a huge blockbuster but worth the watch if you can wait until the story gets going. I cant think of much more to write but i have to have ten lines to submit my review so here they are. ( i think short reviews will get better responses. It was great; it was bad, don&apos;t see it, etc..) Why do we need such a long review? I myself don&apos;t like to read long reviews, just tell me if the movie was good or not!",

            "reviewBody": "Misery is a dark, but witty venture into Stephen King territory.  It&apos;s about a popular novelist who crashes his car on a snowy mountain road and is rescued by a nurse who claims she is his number one fan.  As the time goes by, he realizes she has no intention of letting him leave.\n\nThe film moves with a brisk, taut pace thanks to director Rob Reiner, who helmed another excellent Stephen King film, Stand By Me.  Tension is kept mostly throughout (there are some predictable moments...but who cares?) And the performances are also a major plus.  James Caan is very easy to empathize with, and he manages to keep his cynical sense of humor. Richard Farnsworth, as a grizzled sheriff was a nice addition to the film since his character didn&apos;t exist in the book.  He also has a nice sense of humor, and he&apos;s the kind of guy who you want to root for.  But the most amazing performance is from Kathy Bates, who treads a fine line alternating between sweet and lovable to amazingly evil.  She won an Oscar for this movie, and whole-heartedly deserved it.\n\nSide note:  This is one of the few films which took an Oscar, that you can actually say the Academy had the guts to give out.  Can anyone name another horror film which won such a notable prize?\n\nANyway...by the end, the novelist and the viewer or put through some torturous activity.  We sometimes feel his pain, and it is so much fun to hate this woman................the book is excellent.....the movie is just as good in about 1/6th of the time it would take to read.  Either way, enjoy!"

            "reviewBody": "(1/10/13, one star) Kathryn Bigelow and her new movie Zero Dark Thirty deserve our universal contempt and condemnation for condoning torture. Bigelow revisits the darkest chapter in U.S. history (U.S. torture in the Middle East in the aftermath of 9/11) and dwells on it, not to condemn the actions of U.S. leaders who authorized this campaign of state terror against Muslim prisoners but rather to vindicate the torturers and justify the savagery that earned the undying enmity of millions of Arabs. Bigelow is too crafty to explicitly hold up criminals as heroes worthy of veneration but instead constructs a superficial veneer of faux-journalistic neutrality that will fool only the most gullible along with those anxious to buy into the dangerous delusion she is peddling. She dedicates large segments of her movie to portraying U.S. torturers as selfless patriots and their victims as homicidal maniacs, but not one minute to explaining why they attack us. Of course, we can&apos;t have Americans wondering what our government had been doing to make Muslims hate us so much. And with 9/11 our national descent into deceit, denial and self-delusion began, with no end in sight yet. According to the official myth still being perpetuated by our government and unconscionable propagandists like Bigelow, Muslim radicals are never rational actors but rather just crazed fanatics, to be tortured and destroyed like mad dogs. And now Bigelow compounds this ongoing national folly with the resurrection of its corollary Big Lie: torture of detainees is compatible with democracy, even necessary to protect it.\n\nTorture is just another form of terrorism. When the state tortures detainees, it is state terrorism, directed ultimately against all humanity as well as against individual detainees. Torturers degrade and dehumanize themselves, their victims, and any society that tolerates their crimes. How can anyone claim victory over terrorism when they employ it themselves? Besides, torturers (most famously, the Nazi and Communist regimes in Germany and Russia) have always rationalized torture on grounds of public security, but have always ultimately used torture as a weapon to terrorize the public and crush political opposition. (Do we really want to emulate the Nazis and Communists?) In the long run, torturers are a more pernicious threat to both our security and our liberty than any Al Qaeda agent could ever hope to be.\n\nSenator McCain is right when he says that Zero Dark Thirty gives our enemies powerful ammunition to use against us, especially if it garners awards. Audiences around the world will see the movie as confirmation that the horrors of Abu Ghraib reflect the real soul of America."

            "reviewBody": "What a year it has been for animated films. So far in 2010 we have had three great films from three rival studios. DreamWorks kicked things off with the surprise sleeper hit How to Train Your Dragon and animation juggernaut Pixar countered with the hotly anticipated Toy Story 3. Now Universal&apos;s Illumination Entertainment has released the audaciously titled Despicable Me and while it may be the &quot;worst&quot; of the trio, it is certainly the most purely entertaining.\n\nThe strengths of Despicable Me lie within veins commonly found in animated features, but his entry simply utilizes them extremely effectively. Along with jumping on the 3-D bandwagon (my theatre was screening it in normal dimensions) Despicable Me boasts an impressive voice cast, a ploy first used with Robin Williams way back in the days of traditional days of animation with Aladdin, superbly executed slapstick and what I will call the sidekick factor. Whether cute or wisecracking, you would be hard-pressed to find a film in this medium that does not employ this tactic. Even so called &quot;art-house&quot; animated pictures like WALL-E follow the trend (in fact, that particular film contains two such supporting characters) and Despicable Me ups the ante and adopts thousands.\n\nThe villainous central character of Gru (voiced my Steve Carell) operates his evil lair with the aid of a multitude of adorable little yellow workers, and along with their &quot;awwwee&quot; factor, are the subject of a healthy portion of the aforementioned slapstick. Nestled in between the easy laughs however is ample heart and if you are prone to do so, you may very well shed a tear or two. This warmth is generated by three orphan girls, Margo, Edith and the doe-eyed Agnes, but perhaps I&apos;m getting ahead of myself. \n\nAll Gru has ever wanted is to be accepted, and what better way to achieve that goal than by resorting to supervillainy. After a fresh- faced rival villain Vector (Jason Segel) outdoes Gru by stealing a pyramid from Egypt, he devises a plan to obtain a shrink-ray from a government testing facility and use that technology to shrink, and then steal the moon. Things do not go according to plan after Vector steals the shrink-ray right out of Gru&apos;s spindly clutches. What&apos;s a supervillain to do? Devise another plan of course, this time using the three aforementioned orphans to infiltrate Vector&apos;s lair by selling cookies. It&apos;s all very complicated in writing but works very well on screen.\n\nSteve Carell does an admirable job in the lead voice role, and his Russian accent helps us to forget it is an A-list star nestled behind the animation. Russell Brand gives an unrecognizable performance as Dr. Nefario, the brains behind Gru&apos;s operation, and Kristen Wiig is hilarious as the head of the orphanage. The most disappointing is certainly the great Jason Segel whose underwritten character fails him as does his voice. Half of the allure of Segel is his physical presence and that is neutered in a voice-only role. While the physical humour will no doubt please the kids, there is perhaps even more for adults and if a movie is able to make me double over in the isle, then it must be doing something right. With Shrek Forever After being the one misstep for this medium, I look enthusiastically forward to the remainder of the year. What I know for certain is I (and the audience I joined) had an absolute blast with this flick, that is despicable in name only.\n\nCatch all the latest movie news and reviews at http://playeraffinity.com/movies.html",

            "reviewBody": "I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.\n\nThe cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.\n\nThis was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. \n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "SXSW 2022 Greetings again from the darkness. It seems society has reached a point where most of us are at least a bit skeptical of someone being nice. We assume there is an ulterior motive for acts of altruism. Writer-director-actor Cooper Raiff won a SXSW award for his first feature film (a title I can&apos;t print here), and he follows that up with this feel-good dramedy that may very well inspire us to have a bit more faith in humanity ... well at least some of humanity.\n\nWhen we first meet Andrew (Mr. Raiff), he&apos;s attending the Bar Mitzvah of a classmate, and finds himself attracted to Bella (Kelly O&apos;Sullivan, who was so good in SAINT FRANCIS, 2019), the older &apos;party starter&apos;. What really hits home with Andrew is how Bella takes an obviously unsettling phone call in the stairwell before flipping her smile back on and returning to her hosting duties. We then jump ahead 10 years, and Andrew has just graduated college. His girlfriend heads off to Barcelona while he moves back in with his mother Leslie Mann) and stepdad (Brad Garrett), sleeping on a blow-up mattress in his younger brother David&apos;s (Evan Assante) room. As he contemplates his next step in life, Andrew works the counter at &apos;Meat Sticks&apos;, a shopping mall based fast food stop that forces him to wear a royal blue vest and bright red visor. Talk about motivation for transitioning into adulting.\n\nThis ties back into the early scene of young Andrew because when he accompanies David to a Bar Mitzvah, Andrew is attracted to the beauty Domino (Dakota Johnson), mother of autistic Lola (Vanessa Burghardt). We watch as Andrew&apos;s charm convinces to Lola to dance for the first time, a friendly gesture that intrigues her mother. Things change quickly for Andrew. Other Jewish moms take note of Andrew and hire him as a &apos;party starter&apos;, Domino hires Andrew to periodically babysit Lola, David starts eliciting romance advice from big brother, and Domino and Andrew begin their &quot;will they or won&apos;t they&quot; flirtations.\n\nOf course, things aren&apos;t as simple or rosy as they might seem. Domino has a lawyer fiancé (Raul Castillo), and she&apos;s burdened with emotional pain that she barely acknowledges - though she does admit to Andrew that she struggles with depression. There are also mental health issues associated with Andrew&apos;s mother, and we infer that plays an important part in his own makeup and desire to help others. It turns out Andrew and Domino are both defined (perhaps burdened) by their need to help others, while ignoring their own well-being. Neither are saints, as both have flaws. An engaged Domino battles her urges with Andrew, while he drinks too much, has a jealous streak, and snaps at loved ones when upset.\n\nFilmmaker Raiff benefits from a terrific and fully engaged performance from Ms. Dakota. Raiff himself is not a polished actor, but this is an advantage for his role as Andrew - a young man drifting at a time he should be focused. The film takes a sincere approach to characters we know. The cringe-factor rarely, if ever, pops up. The most cynical might find it saccharine, but most will appreciate the sweetness Andrew displays as he fumbles around with what love means. He may be somewhat goofy, but he&apos;s also good-hearted, and enjoys making a difference and helping others. Raiff&apos;s film may be as eager to please as its protagonist, yet that&apos;s not such a bad thing. And yes, the &quot;Cha Cha Slide&quot; does feature in a dance scene, so the film&apos;s title isn&apos;t totally off the wall (but almost).",

Sonic 2 takes the live action universe of Sonic and adds not only familar faces in Tails and Knuckles, but adds its own spin of the Sonic franchise&apos;s lore from the original 3 Sonic games. Whenever Sonic, Knuckles, Tails and Eggman are on the screen this film, its a fun spectacle and a fun time for Sonic fans.\n\nIf however you are not a Sonic fan, and/or don&apos;t have children, this movie will probably not do much for you. References from the original games (and beyond) will be totally lost on you and the film is definitely a kids film. Also as a Sonic fan, this film isn&apos;t perfect. There is a small subplot involving some of the human side characters halfway in the film sends this film on a weird, confusing detour that adds barely anything to the overall experience. The Movie does recover from this bizarre sidetrack to a fan&apos;s dream of a final fight.\n\nI cannot wait for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and I do hope this film and franchise succeeds so we may see more of the franchises fan-favourite characters on the big screen!\n\nI wonder what Tails and Knuckles would&apos;ve looked like had we not have a redesign...",

But even at only 96 min runtime, it felt too bloated with cliched filler, and the substance stretched out to the max. It&apos;ll be the casting and performances that hold your attention, especially Cranston and Wilson. I found Bening&apos;s character to be too aloof and cliched. The filmmakers should&apos;ve cut this one down to a max 60 min TV-length movie, because even with the great casting, many of the scenes felt dragged out to the point you could fast-forward, and not miss a thing. The ending credits where they show photos of the real Selbee&apos;s was a nice touch. It&apos;s a fun one time watch, and a 7/10 from me.",

So when it came to me and I mumbled &quot;The Goonies&quot;, I was expecting scorn, ridicule and possibly minor injury, but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of &quot;Hey you gu-uys!&quot; from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies; mention it in a room full of twenty-somethings and they&apos;ll whell up and utter &quot;Sloth loves Chunk&quot; or adopt a harassed Chinese tone &quot;Thats what I said...Booty traps!&quot;. And if that room happens to be a pub, several chairs will scrape back and semi-inebriated grown men will lift their shirts, shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it&apos;s an Indiana Jones wanna-be I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We&apos;d loved seeing Indiana&apos;s adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the mini-Indies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film, we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes, and we wanted to protect them, and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why, as adults, we quote them and &apos;become&apos; them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy, having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey! I also think that this is why Goonies 2 is such a relevant and exciting concept. We&apos;ve all grown up together and I&apos;d love to see how the guys are doing now...I just hope it doesn&apos;t disappoint... So if you&apos;ve not seen it do it right now, and if you have kids sit them down, hold their hand through the scary bits and enjoy! They&apos;ll thank you in twenty years time!",

With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.\n\nInceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.\n\nThe director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.\n\nThe acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn&apos;t win an Oscar for his performance.\n\nMeanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.\n\nTo finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I&apos;ve seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.\n\nI highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won&apos;t be disappointed.",

But I personally still didn&apos;t like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn&apos;t appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you.",

Most of the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all action plots - some &quot;bad dudes who happen to be really ugly&quot; decide to &quot;destroy the world for no reason other than being evil&quot; and &quot;only our hero can save us all&quot;, etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. \n\nOf course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn&apos;t expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in 2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.",

            "reviewBody": "Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a struggling lower class bathroom attendant in 1950s Manhattan. He&apos;s mistaken for being in the world of the super wealthy when an upper crust man hires Tom to retrieve his wayward son Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) from Italy for $1000. He finds Dickie with his girlfriend Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) and is lured into the world of the leisure class. When Dickie gets tired of Tom, Tom does the unthinkable and uses his underhanded skills to hang on.\n\nDirector/writer Anthony Minghella has instilled a sense of dread and foreboding. The acting is top notch with the most important coming from Matt Damon and Jude Law. There are honorable mentions to Philip Seymour Hoffman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett. I do wish they play up Tom Ripley&apos;s homosexual side with Dickie and intensify the creepiness. Other than that, this movie has the perfect tone and sense of doom. It is such a perverse movie that you almost root for the conniving Tom Ripley.",

            "reviewBody": "Mr. Malcolm&apos;s List is the glamorous adventure of the year! The film transports fans into the Regency era for a tale filled with romance and exquisite music.\n\nMr. Malcolm&apos;s List is set in 1818, where the most eligible bachelor, Mr. James Malcolm (Sope Dirisu) looks for a wife. He meets Julia Thistlewaite (Zawe Ashton) who he believes isn&apos;t worthy of his courtship because she does not meet his list of qualifications for a wife. Julia is embarrassed in society&apos;s newspaper so she plans her revenge on Mr. Malcolm. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Allain.\n\nThis film shows how Regency era pieces have taken the world by storm. The movie is lighthearted, overflowing with gorgeous dresses, beautiful ballrooms and witty comedy. There was a short film based on Mr. Malcolm&apos;s List previously released, with several cast members returning for this feature. It&apos;s wonderful to have the entire story fleshed out, taking its time to tell the entire tale without feeling rushed. Sam Heughan reprises his role as Henry. Audiences can see that he feels more comfortable with this role, which adds to the greatness of this character. The story itself is unique and keeps viewers on the edge of their seat. With the series Bridgerton giving fans several love stories with people who are head over heels for each other, it&apos;s refreshing to have Mr. Malcolm&apos;s List be the complete opposite. A woman taking revenge on a man for embarrassing her in society is as comedic as it is powerful. The writers have given Julia such power in proving herself worthwhile and she ends up finding love under unlikely circumstances. The film gives personality and color to our ideas of what people were like in the early 1800s. Two friends spending their free time pondering on how to ruin the life of the most eligible bachelor in London, just because they think it&apos;ll be fun, is exciting and totally unpredictable. Every second of this film is compelling.\n\nThe moral of this story is to honor yourself. Julia never lets anyone degrade her. Whereas some women during this time period would have let a man embarrass her and move on, Julia gives James a taste of his own medicine. She is never upset about not meeting his requirements, but instead becomes furious that he has a list to begin with.\n\nI give Mr. Malcolm&apos;s List 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases in theaters July 1, 2022.\n\nBy Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",

            "reviewBody": "Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I&apos;ll give you people that - I&apos;ve seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo &amp; Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn&apos;t just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job."
