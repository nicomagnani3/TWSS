I watched the movie in cinemas (Laser Ultra) with a few friends and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I think it&apos;s also fair to say that I&apos;m a Marvel fan, as well as a superhero movie fan in general. Enjoy the review!\n\nStory Aspects: \n* Entertainment: 7,5/10\n* Story: 8/10\n* Execution: 7/10\n\n\nThree Act Structure: \n* First act: 7,5/10\n* Second act: 9/10\n* Third act: 6,5/10\n\n\nCharacters: \n* Casting: 9/10\n* Acting: 7,5/10\n* Dialogue: 6/10\n* Emotional attachment: 7/10\n* Protagonist: 8/10\n* Antagonist: 9/10\n* Tertiaries &amp; Extras: 7,5/10\n\n\nEnvironment &amp; Vibe: \n* Action: 7/10\n* Humor: 6,5/10\n* Horror: 7/10\n* Creativity/Risk: 9/10\n* Pacing: 6/10\n* Logic: 5/10\n* Atmosphere: 8/10\n\n\nFilmography: \n* Score: 7,5/10\n* Editing: 8/10\n* Cinematography: 8/10\n* Direction: 8/10\n* Costume design: 9/10\n\n\nNotes: \n* General runtime too short for a story this large\n* The world building capable due to the Multiverse concept isn&apos;t used to its full potential.\n\n\nTOTAL RATING: 7,5/10.",

            "reviewBody": "Wonderfly shot. Love the serial killer type approach. Matt Reeves never disappoints with choice of color, tone and over all cinematography.\n\nThat being said, the story wasnt that interesting to be honest. Nothing was surprising or intriguing and because of that, the result was a poor nonthreatening antagonist\n\nAs for character casting, Zoe Kravitz is probably the worst Catwoman. Not one Catwoman characteristic was displayed. Might as well get anyone to play Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright was surprisingly a good Jim Gordan although i have no idea when Batman had a partner lol. John Turturro just looks too goofy to pull off as some crazy mob boss/supporting antagonist. Colin Farrell was amazing 👊\n\nThe greatest detective/tactician failed to do any real detective work. Solved a few riddles and off we go. Bale still #1\n\nAll in all great production, good acting (especially from Pattison and Farrell). Would I recommend watching it? Yea i guess. A second time... probably not.",

The film itself is entertaining and the cast delivers great performances all around, this role shows that Alexander Skarsgård has what it takes to be a top tier dramatic actor as he arguably delivers a career-high performance.\n\nNow for people contemplating whether or not they should see the film because Eggers&apos; films so far have been &quot;too artsy&quot; and &quot;not for the general audience&quot; should put their worries aside and purchase their tickets because there isn&apos;t much to worry about even though there will be many classic Eggers shots he is typically known for.\n\nAs for the small negatives about the film; I felt disappointed in how little we got of Dafoe as he often shines with these types of directors. I do also have to say that the movie isn&apos;t exactly how it is shown in the trailers (less action in the final product), some people claim the trailers are superior and even though I enjoyed my time in the cinema I slightly agree with those claims.",

            "reviewBody": "Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future.",

But &quot;The Bad Guys&quot; turned out to be a very clever movie, well-made, with a sophisticated script, and fast-moving. Most importantly: It&apos;s not taking itself too seriously. I mean: A shark as a master of disguise!?\n\nI don&apos;t know (yet) the books on which this movie is based. Oviously the story is also inspired by the various Ocean&apos;s 8/ 11/ 12/ whatever-movies, but it is definitely an over-the-top-version of these caper movies. These movies always tried to be believable; &quot;the bad guys&quot; tries to be fun. And it succeeded in that!",

            "reviewBody": "An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I&apos;m quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth&apos;s character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn&apos;t have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn&apos;t watch it again, but I certainly didn&apos;t mind watching it. It isn&apos;t the most memorable, but I certainly don&apos;t have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.\n\nMy Rating: 5.8/10.",

Most of the problems relate to the source material and the fuzzy, hazy nature of the narrative. From a cinematic perspective, it&apos;s an impressive production with an evocative re-creation of 1960 Puerto Rico. Depp is suave and charismatic, Aaron Eckhart, one of the few working actors who can convincingly wear a white hat or a black one, is in full  mode. And Amber Heard is as sexy as a woman can be, especially during a nightclub dance. The Rum Diary fails because of the screenplay, and the screenplay stumbles because it shows too much reverence to its source material. The contrived romance is half-presented. The comedy is hit-and-miss. The main character&apos;s arc, which transforms him from a drunken libertarian to a crusader for the undertrodden, is half-described. The conflict between the protagonist and antagonist is left unresolved. In fact, the entire story has an unfinished, half-baked sensibility."

On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.\n\nOn the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I&apos;m all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn&apos;t care for how naïve Tom Holland&apos;s version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to &quot;fix&quot; the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.",

Sonic and Tails were great together and had a cute friendship.\n\nKnuckles was funny in how he didn&apos;t understand most things but he is tough and wants to complete his quest for the Master Emerald.\n\nJim Carrey was still great as Dr. Robotnik/Eggman, he is still funny and gives a over the top performance that shows he is having fun with it.\n\nThe action scenes are fun and awesome seeing with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles interacting off each other. Especially the Sonic vs Knuckles fight, it is worth seeing on the big screen.\n\nThe 3rd act is amazing and fun while also having Easter eggs from the games that Sonic fans will recognize and find funny. Also the different locations they go to are nicely shot.\n\nThe after credits scene is amazing and will get you excited for the future of the Sonic movie series. Sonic fans will love it.\n\nThe movie is fun, funny, and has epic moments that are worth seeing in the theater. The characters are likable and the human characters like James Marsden were also great and funny.",

            "reviewBody": "Nick Cage: &quot;Is that supposed to be me? It&apos;s ... grotesque.&quot;\n\nThe unbelievable part of The Unbelievable Weight of Immense Talent is that it&apos;s all true (in a figurative way). Nicolas Cage can play himself, Nick Cage, because the many films he&apos;s been in, some worthwhile (Moonstruck, Raising Arizona, Face/Off) and some terrible (take your pick), have prepared him for a true meta experience, like John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich or the cast playing themselves in Robert Altman&apos;s The Player.\n\nOf course, it&apos;s hilarious because Cage is usually a witty version of himself and making fun of himself anyway (except when he wins the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas). With the help of director Tom Gormican and writer Kevin Etten, Unbearable is a metanarrative of Nick as a burgeoning hero for his daughter, Addy (Lily Sheen), and a buddy for a drug kingpin, Avi (Pedro Pascal), with whom he writes a joke thriller, which Unbearable turns out to be.\n\nPascal&apos;s performance as a thorough Cage fan and possible drug lord emphasizes the often-close emotional bond between fans, star, and film. There is little difference between us and Avi in our love for the actor and his roles.\n\nThroughout this comedy, the art of filmmaking turns out to take center screen as the principals dog out a workable script that they really are starring in here, more or less because the fusion of art and life is blurred. The varied facets of filmmaking and the actor&apos;s relationship with his audience are never far from the surface. Nor is it stagnant because each Cage film is a mirror for Hollywood&apos;s immediate needs and its actor&apos;s. In Unbearable Nick&apos;s striving for the &quot;part of a lifetime,&quot; never far from a cliché.\n\nFor Nicolas Cage, such is his life, and the film makes fun of his accepting roles solely for getting cash to pay his bills, and maybe, just maybe, for the joy of acting, for which he&apos;s indicted when he loses the people closest to him because of his obsession for acting.\n\nAs Cage plays himself, he stumbles on the right script to reconcile him with his family and win the admiration of his audience. He&apos;s never far from his Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas or a &quot;should-have-been-nominated&quot; in Pig. A good will pervades this complex comedy, largely because Cage has a good heart hidden underneath his thespian ambitions, real or fictional."

Since it was called &quot;The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot; i I was expecting a lot more in depth exploration of the character and the history with Grindelwald etc. But nothing particularly interesting or that we didn&apos;t already know was revealed. The movie is filled with so much action and sub-plots that kids would maybe enjoy but felt very unnecessary. The reasoning behind all the drama felt a bit ridiculous and ultimately degrading to the source material, I could not take the plot seriously.\n\nThis is not how I imagine the history of these Harry Potter characters unravelling and I doubt many fans find it plausible or likeable. It&apos;s hard to believe JK Rowling had much creative input on this film, as I don&apos;t think she would ever write something like this, even though she co-wrote and produced it. I feel like the second movie was bad so this one was just trying to work with the mess of a story it was left with.\n\nThis movie is not completely unenjoyable though, If I did not care as much about taking the plot seriously and staying truthful to the Harry Potter universe, i&apos;d have liked it more. Some of it was quite funny and there was some cool editing and cinematography, as well as the casting being pretty good and decent acting.",

            "reviewBody": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&apos;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.\n\nThis film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&apos;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.\n\nBut it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it&apos;s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter&apos;s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.\n\nThe more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone&apos;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister&apos;s wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.\n\nInside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.\n\nThis is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.\n\nMost masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",

            "reviewBody": "There was embarrassing writing, embarrassing acting, and listening to Amber Heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting. Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they&apos;re from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The &quot;advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world&quot; trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said &quot;Ocean Master&quot; with a straight face I wanted to laugh.\n\nThis would&apos;ve been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.\n\nHow many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn&apos;t hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - &quot;Wow there was a surprise and now we&apos;re accidentally holding hands&quot;, &quot;Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you &quot; - give me a break. And whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed.",

            "reviewBody": "Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven&apos;t noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in &apos;The Gentlemen&apos; is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn&apos;t change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I&apos;ve seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I&apos;ve ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn&apos;t even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they&apos;d dubbed it. They hadn&apos;t, he&apos;d just nailed it.\n\nThe style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you&apos;ve seen any of Ritchie&apos;s previous similar films (&apos;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&apos;, &apos;Snatch&apos;, &apos;RocknRolla&apos;) then you know what I&apos;m talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.\n\nEvery time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn&apos;t a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It&apos;s not that the other stuff he&apos;s doing is bad (&apos;Swept Away&apos; being an obvious exception), it&apos;s just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He&apos;s the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I&apos;d be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.",

You can tell that the writers have spent a lot of time on sapphic Ao3 because they nail every beloved trope perfectly.\n\nThe cast is wonderful as well. Auli&apos;i Cravalho is a revelation. I have rarely seen someone representing pining so well Mega Mullaly is hilarious and plays such an amazing mom. Rowan Blanchard does a fine job of playing a gay mess\n\nAn especially great thing is that there is zero homophobia in this movie. Not unlike Schitt&apos;s Creek queer people here are just allowed to be without having to constantly represent the everyday day they face\n\nOf course this movie is not for anyone. It&apos;s meant for the queer community and if you are not part of it a lot of it might go over your head or make you angry(the way several borderline homophobic reviews have already shown).",

Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise&apos;s charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum&apos;s charisma shines through and Pitt&apos;s cameo provides flavor, but that isn&apos;t enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn&apos;t painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.\n\nMeanwhile, The Lost City&apos;s filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative). Lastly, The Lost City lacks cohesion. Its humor and emotions never tonally blend, and instead take turns (which disconnects viewers). Ultimately, The Lost City has mild appeal, but functions inconsistently.\n\nWriting: 3/10 Direction: 3/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Acting: 5/10 Editing: 4/10 Sound: 6/10 Score/Soundtrack: 4/10 Production Design: 6/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 6/10\n\nOverall Score: 5.1/10.",

            "reviewBody": "Top Gun is undoubtedly one of my favourite films, and one of those that has the ability to keep enthralling you even while watching for the tenth time. Director Tony Scott was chosen after the producers saw his work in advertising, and true to their judgement he has produced a visual masterpiece. It looks simply gorgeous, and the live action sequences have never been bettered. If there is one flaw in the film it is that it is somewhat shallow, with all of the people behind the film (and Tom Cruise) rather better at making visual spectaculars than an engaging story. However the story does work well in drawing you into the world of Maverick and his fellow naval aviators, Cruise forms an excellent rapport with Anthony Edwards as Goose, and the dialogue is snappy and eminently quotable. Everyone has at some stage used Maverick&apos;s line - &quot;I couls tell you, but then I&apos;d have to kill you&quot;, and the cover of the Righteous Brothers is unforgettable. The film is backed by one of the best soundtracks of the decade, and a very strong supporting cast. In my opinion, the film succeeds in everything it sets out to achieve. A cracking script, a gripping story, and simply stunning aerial photography. You have to see this film."

Back on earth, he is betrayed by fellow astronaut Jocinda Fowler (Halle Berry) and gets blamed for human error. It&apos;s ten years later. Brian is a shell of himself. Conspiracy theorist KC Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that the moon&apos;s orbit is deteriorating and headed for earth. He tries to recruit Brian to contact NASA.\n\nDirector Roland Emmerich has woven a conspiracy theory into his brand of action sci-fi thriller. I like the potential. I even like the outlandish concept. The first half is a little clunky but I&apos;m willing to go with it. The problematic writing does build up over time. It&apos;s his never-ending close calls and melodramas. It&apos;s the awkward sci-fi. The second half stumbles here and there until it falls flat. Roland is no longer that guy anymore. He&apos;s not making the big budget action thriller hits.",

With mere weeks before impact and the world on the brink of annihilation, NASA executive and former astronaut Jo Fowler (Academy Award® winner Halle Berry) is convinced she has the key to saving us all - but only one astronaut from her past, Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson, &quot;Midway&quot;) and a conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman (John Bradley, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;) believes her. These unlikely heroes will mount an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love, only to find out that our Moon is not what we think it is."

            "reviewBody": "&quot;Anyone can be tailor.&quot; Leonard (Mark Rylance)\n\nAlthough sometimes I can&apos;t tell if I love film more than theater, with The Outfit I found a film that satisfies both affections. Writer-director Grahame Moore brings a Hitchcock frame of mind with one dominant location, an atelier holding no more than four or five characters, just like a theater stage, and a sense of foreboding coming from history and the characters themselves, just like the modern psychological thrillers do.\n\nJust watch out for those scissors-Hitch would love the touch.\n\nUnderneath the simple set is a rumbling of sin as the meek tailor, Leonard, contends with three mobs threatening him and his secretary, Mable (Zoey Deutch). He is required to stitch around those who want to kill each other and destroy his business, with different crooks coming in the front door intent on finding a tape that allegedly would send them to jail.\n\nThe joy of this neo-noir thriller is the suspense that Hitchcock virtually patented because his non-mob characters are seemingly innocent types, and his sinners not quite in control of their ambitions. What Hitch and other thriller directors like Moore want is to show the vulnerability of the common citizen and the weaknesses of the seasoned mobsters.\n\nAlthough it&apos;s up to Leonard, small haberdashery owner in Chicago, to protect his shop, he also, in a narcotic-like voice over, explains the allegorical implications of his cutting and sewing. For instance, he is not a tailor but rather a cutter. The former artless, the latter a professional trained for years on London&apos;s iconic Saville Row.\n\nNo recent film has surpassed The Outfit&apos;s ability to reveal the wickedness of humanity and its adaptability while supplying a dose of old-time noir. Delight in the spare set, the super acting, and the innumerable closeups that do as much to reveal character as the uncomplicated, Pinter-like dialogue.\n\nAlthough this tidy feature, similar to Leonard in its meticulous revelation of character and motive, seems suited to streaming, it is a euphoric experience on the big screen as the spare audiences can be enveloped by the powerful characters and story, in a setting that puts all in a dynamic room with mystery aplenty."

            "reviewBody": "Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney&apos;s first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.\n\nOther than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character&apos;s personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of &apos;Pirates&apos; reads like a Who&apos;s Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.\n\nWhen screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early &apos;90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (E.T., Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Back to the Future to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.\n\nI liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt&apos;s performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner&apos;s in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, &apos;Pirates&apos; is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy &apos;Pirates&apos;.\n\nThat is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom&apos;s performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.\n\nLet us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor&apos;s daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you&apos;re a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that&apos;s about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.\n\nA few predictions may be in order, however. Look for an Oscar nomination for Depp&apos;s efforts. Look for nominations as well for sound, set design, makeup, and cinematography. As far as best picture? Next to Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)? Not likely.\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski, who used to play in a punk rock band and is best known for creating the Budweiser frogs, does an outstanding job keeping track of the myriad details required of a director, given his limited experience. True, &apos;Pirates&apos; has countless errors in continuity, but those occur in any film of such scope. Mr. Verbinski has only four other films to his name: a short entitled The Ritual (1996), and then three very different but effectively made films, Mouse Hunt (1997), The Mexican (2001), and the very creepy thriller The Ring (2002). Again, it makes one wonder just who is at the helm of the USS Disney to put a $125 million movie in the hands of a neophyte. Well, it worked with Lord of the Rings and a very inexperienced Peter Jackson, and it worked here for Disney as well.\n\n&apos;Pirates of the Caribbean&apos; is a fun movie for most of the family. It may be rather scary for children ten and under and somewhat boring for many over twenty-five. I enjoyed it immensely for exactly what it was... an amusing ride."

Their resonant work makes this a breezily watchable experience.\n\nThere is also an attempt to take on its government corruption themes with a little more intelligence than lesser thrillers have shown in the past.\n\nUnfortunately, none of this stops this film from being a largely dull, uninspired rehash of generic action movie plot points that have been done better in dozens of other, better movies.\n\nThe action sequences are almost completely bereft of thrills, just going for shot/reverse shot during shootouts and shoddy choreography during fights.\n\nEach character is reduced to what they do for a living, not really having much of a personality or set of convictions beyond that.\n\nLastly, the &quot;unreliable memory of the protagonist&quot; concept is barely used in the story. It could have been used to create a mystery to the events that unfold and what is actually real, but it isn&apos;t. All the story&apos;s questions are provided with quick and easy answers, and it all results in a very disappointing story with no emotional or intellectual impact.\n\nI ended up leaving the theater feeling nothing, because the movie just isn&apos;t bad enough nor good enough for anything to be felt or remembered.",

            "reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sing 2 was better than the original. Although I didn&apos;t have an extremely high opinion of the first film, this sequel took the same elements and really blew me away. All the characters are true to their personalities and develop more as they confront challenges on a larger scale than ever before. Tired of being overlooked, the ever ambitious Buster Moon cheats his way into the dazzling Redford City and wins over Crystal and his daughter... for as long as he can! The rest of the cast find they&apos;re not what it takes, as Suki had warned them, but they force themselves to make the show work, no matter what. Throughout this film we get many new characters and some returning ones, which does mess up the flow of the film and makes the plot feel choppy at times, but it all comes together at the end.",

Above all, while it&apos;s reasonable to modernise the Bond character, we may have now reached a point of no return for the spirit of Fleming&apos;s real Bond. The next movie will be make - or I fear break - to the substance of what has made Bond movies distinctive and great.",

And thus, I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch what writers Jonathan Tropper, T. S. Nowlin, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin had in store with this movie.\n\nAnd honestly, then the movie was every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as anticipated. Which means that director Shawn Levy managed to do a great job at bringing the script and storyline to life on the screen in an enjoyable and entertaining manner.\n\nSure, &quot;The Adam Project&quot; is the type of movie where you essentially just lean back, munch on the snacks and watch the movie. Yeah, it wasn&apos;t particularly a very cerebral movie, despite of it revolving around something as complex as time travel. But hey, it is a movie meant for entertainment after all, this wasn&apos;t exactly an exact science.\n\nVisually then &quot;The Adam Project&quot; is rather impressive. But of course, with a movie project such as this, the funding is large and very capable of sustaining great visuals. And a movie such as &quot;The Adam Project&quot; does need proper CGI effects to fully function as intended on the screen. And trust me, the effects served their purpose.\n\n&quot;The Adam Project&quot; has a good cast ensemble, which funnily enough brought together four members of the Marvel CMU, a funny little detail. Especially since &quot;The Adam Project&quot; does poke fun at aforementioned MCU. The movie has the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana and Jennifer Garner on the cast list to carry the movie, which they did quite well. In addition, the young actor Walker Scobell really managed to stand tall among such established performers.\n\nWhile &quot;The Adam Project&quot; certainly is a watchable and enjoyable movie, it hardly strikes me as a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as the storyline just didn&apos;t have all that much solid contents to it.\n\nMy rating of &quot;The Adam Project&quot; lands on a six out of ten stars.",

How on Earth did they think this would appeal?\n\nIt&apos;s a lifeless watch, it rambles along at a torturous pace, and sadly half the cast seem totally disinterested, giving very wooden performances.\n\nSpecial effects vary, some look good, some look very poor, when you look at the budget this film had, it should have looked flawless, it doesn&apos;t.\n\nI love Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but neither of them look totally at home here, I only hope this turkey of a movie doesn&apos;t halt either career.\n\nI don&apos;t think a second will follow somehow.\n\nAwful sadly, I did give it a second watch to be sure, but there you are, it&apos;s a shocker, 3/10.",

Everything about the film has a sophisticated, elegant feel, from the constume design to the atmosphere and cinematography. This is a classy film.\n\nAlthough, in a way, this is to the film&apos;s detriment. The story is almost told with a mask on, it&apos;s difficult to see beyond the flawless surface and connect emotionally with the film. Everything is too nicey nicey, each scene is so perfectly crafted that it almost distracts you from what&apos;s actually happening in the film.\n\nThis is a very good film, but it could have been an excellent one, had it made more of an emotional connection with the audience.",

I&apos;ve seen Michelle Williams look beautiful and amazingly desirable. None of these feature in Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\n\nInstead you get a constant gay married couple bickering between Venom and Brock which is supposed to be insightful and funny, but isn&apos;t, a cardboard psychopathic villain that could have been sympathetic with just a few edits, a pointless villain girlfriend that has no influence on the plot of the film whatsoever, even though she has a superpower she is inconsequential, a pointless hero girlfriend who is there just to be a damsel in distress, copy pasted from the bad Spiderman films, a policeman who is there just to be the always late to the joke guy and... Dan? Who cares about Dan?! I swear the most interesting character in this film is the mean Chinese lady at the store. There is no chemistry between any of the characters. None!\n\nBut the worse problem is that there is no story, no tension, nothing to solve. The interaction between hero and villain is minimal yet stretching imagination and both their paths when separate are boring uninteresting bad writing.\n\nEven the CGI fights feel pointless, as two blobs fight each other by hitting and throwing each other. Venom knows ALL the weaknesses of a symbiont and does nothing with it. Brock knows his symbiont and does nothing with it.\n\nThe more I write in this review the more stars disappear from the rating, so I will just stop. This could have been the exact same movie with ten times less budget, cheap CGI and unknown actors. No one would have noticed a difference. And there is one end credits scene that is more interesting in its implications than the entire movie!! Ugh.",

The newest addition to the franchise tries something new but - while there are for sure some good aspects - tastes like a bad mixed cocktail: the ingredients (or parts) just don&apos;t work too well together. The King&apos;s Man: no fail but compared to Kingsman: The Secret Service this one is just another rather weak entry.",

This comes complete with power struggles, traitors in our midst and running around shirtless carrying a gun à la Ripley.\n\nMichelle Monaghan is a decent actress, but Sigourney Weaver she is not, we get an abundance of doubting, shouting and pouting, running through nondescript corridors as the body count rises.\n\nThis all plays out to a heavily telegraphed ending, so obvious a blind ten-year old could see it coming. Most disturbingly, the makers naïvely included a massive hook for a sequel that nobody wants or needs.",

            "reviewBody": "As both a lover of the Harry Potter Universe and a lover of movie going, I was thoroughly disappointed, even angry with this movie. While the visuals are as magical as ever, it&apos;s clear that the filmmakers are so distracted by trying to build a franchise that they&apos;re forgetting to actually tell a good story! The chemistry between our main four heroes was diluted by so many new characters being introduced. With so many new people and also so many questions for our old heroes, there wasn&apos;t enough time for any kind of (explainable) character development or for the viewers to connect with anyone on the screen. The only &quot;character development&quot; with one of our main heroes felt random and out of character and we aren&apos;t given much reason or warning for this change. I was also very disappointed with the writing behind Tina&apos;s character as her role was demoted from a strong willed Auror and woman to merely a side kick and love interest. Huge and important elements of the story were left for us only to assume what had happened when discussing the one year time jump between the two films (like the Jacob/Queenie relationship, Jacobs memory, etc.). As a whole, the film screamed &quot;money hungry&quot; and &quot;franchise building&quot; rather than letting us really connect with the characters. It also seemed as if they were only adding in twists that would surely get a reaction from viewers despite the fact that they not only discredited the original Harry Potter films, but just felt like unrealistic and a little too convenient! In short, as a huge fan of the Harry Potter Universe, I was disappointed, upset and felt really let down, and as a film goer, I was confused with the plot and frustrated with the lack of character connection and development! The only reason I have given a 4/10 instead of a 1 is for Eddie Redmayne&apos;s perfect execution of the shy, socially awkward but loveable and charming Newt Scamander and for the alluring performance from Jude Law&apos;s Dumbledore who leaves us wanting to know more of his history! But in the end, it was a huge disappointment as a stand-alone movie.",

            "reviewBody": "Over the past thirty years, Guillermo del Toro has directed some of the most haunting movies: &quot;Cronos&quot;, &quot;Mimic&quot;, &quot;The Devil&apos;s Backbone&quot;, &quot;Pan&apos;s Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;. He now adds &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, a disturbing look at a man&apos;s overconfidence.\n\nBradley Cooper plays a man who joins a traveling carnival but begins letting his belief in his own abilities get the better of him, especially after he starts associating with a morally ambiguous psychologist. Cate Blanchett&apos;s performance as the psychologist is what makes the movie, in my opinion. That and the production design create one of the most mind-blowing things that you&apos;ll ever see; it certainly earned its Academy Award nomination for production design.\n\nI don&apos;t know if I would call this the year&apos;s best movie, but it&apos;s one of the most impressive. Along with Cooper and Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Toni Collette, Willem Dafoe, David Strathairn, Mary Steenburgen, Ron Perlman, Richard Jenkins and a host of other people put on splendid performances. You should definitely check this movie out.",

Extremely entertaining and connected with Verbinski&apos;s style and work. Lots of beautiful action scenes, nice landscapes, humour and never ever, at any point boring. Jack Sparrow is definitely back in great form. 8/10",

            "reviewBody": "I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I&apos;m sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can&apos;t do that, since that isn&apos;t my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you&apos;re a fan of J.K. Rowling&apos;s magical world. \n\nFor starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. \n\nThe creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it&apos;s more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they&apos;re all filled with personality. The sequences when they&apos;re catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. \n\nHowever there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There&apos;s also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn&apos;t that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. \n\nStill these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It&apos;s filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn&apos;t flawless by any means it&apos;s certainly entertaining!",

Don&apos;t really know what to say apart from I enjoyed it. Was it the era it&apos;s based in, was it the chemistry the characters shared, was it the way it was filmed, the dialogues, or was it the idyll charm Alana and Gary created? I don&apos;t know. It felt like the writers just started writing with no actual plot line, let the story flow and develop on it&apos;s own, because I can tell you what happened in the movie but don&apos;t really know what the movie&apos;s about yet it was still perfect the way it was. Felt like just watching life unfold for the characters. It wasn&apos;t complicated, at no point do you feel the script was altered to make it more witty, funny or dramatic, everything was just natural. I think more movies like this should be made. I wasn&apos;t around in the 70&apos;s, but movies like this make it feel like I&apos;m right there with them; nostalgia to a time I never knew. Come to think of it, maybe that&apos;s why I do love it."

            "reviewBody": "I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that&apos;s because I admit this film&apos;s faults. It certainly isn&apos;t near perfect but I felt very moved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be able to relate to this film however those of us that do can say that everything about this depiction of love has been experienced and is real. As a grown single adult living in today&apos;s dating world I can attest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Their obsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep and possibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Love sometimes doesn&apos;t make sense and can&apos;t be described or made logical. Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness and despair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it&apos;s represented on. So many times have I given myself up for something that a year later I looked back on and couldn&apos;t reconcile my behavior, and so many times have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before it completely devoured me. I don&apos;t know if I have been in love, but I have felt what these characters are going through and I wouldn&apos;t know what else to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier I think Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes the acting isn&apos;t great and yes the story is dry, but it&apos;s a genuine take on what relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties to early thirties and I loved every second of it.",

            "reviewBody": "The smartest move DC ever made was to quit concerning themselves with cinematic world building and focus on making (mostly) standalone films that were simply entertaining...and didn&apos;t require a master&apos;s degree in Snydernomics to appreciate.\n\nTheir second smartest move was nabbing James Gunn for The Suicide Squad, and not just because the first film was terrible. Material like this needs Gunn&apos;s flair for irreverence, clever dialogue and, most importantly, instilling characters with engaging personalities. He may not have created Suicide Squad, but this adaptation has his stamp all over it.\n\nAnd for the first time since his directorial debut, Slither, Gunn is unbound by the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, something else the material really needed. Hence, the film is vivid, violent and vulgar, yet at the same time, seldom feels pandering or gratuitous. Punctuated by gobs of gags and hilarious dialogue, the movie earns its dismemberments and f-bombs along the way. In fact, the whole thing plays very much like Guardians of the Galaxy without a filter.\n\nAnd like Guardians, it&apos;s ultimately the characters that matter. Ironically, the one we&apos;re most familiar with - Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) - is the least interesting, perhaps because she&apos;s already been established with two previous films and there isn&apos;t much more Gunn could do with her. But everyone else is wonderfully realized and played perfectly by the ensemble cast. As Bloodsport, the de-facto leader of this new team, Idris Elba strikes the right balance of stoicism and uncertainty, while John Cena (as Peacemaker) once-again demonstrates he&apos;s more adept at comedy than pure action. Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmaichian) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) are also fun, each with amusing backstories. But King Shark steals every scene he&apos;s in, a perpetually hungry manfish who manages to be both monstrous and endearing (and a role Sylvester Stallone was born to play).\n\nWith the exception of Task Force X director Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the antagonists are perfunctory. Their plan, however, is gloriously insane; the dictator of Corto Maltese plans to wipe out America using a 30-year-old experiment gone wrong: Starro, a giant extraterrestrial starfish that spawns face-hugging offspring to re-animate &amp; control the dead. This leads to a final act that&apos;s as hilarious as it is grotesque, aided by amusing visual effects.\n\nUnlike the first film - which was mostly just bells &amp; whistles - The Suicide Squad is the complete package, delivering an abundance of action, humor, violence and well-realized characters. James Gunn&apos;s playful approach is just what was needed, making it the best - and maybe the smartest - DC film since Christopher Nolan hung up his spurs.",

            "reviewBody": "This movie is funnier than the ads will have you believe.\n\nThe story is of a amateur (to put it kindly) boxer who is scrappy in life. He&apos;s told often that he can&apos;t do something or that life gives him hardship and his stubborn streak kicks in. To a lot of people, his persistence is read as silly and frustrating. To a lot of people he should be beaten to death in an alley somewhere in some small rural town he hails from. Until a fateful night which puts a lot of his life in perspective. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t feel that moment is enough to generate the turn of the cheek. But, writer/director Rosalind Ross was smart enough to show how little Stuart actually changes. He instead uses his blue-collar nastiness for good rather than evil. Funny to me, to say the least. I wish they would&apos;ve played more in that world. Where people expect him to be pious and uptight but ends up being a thug in a collar. There may have been extra chuckles to be mined there, ala Harrison Ford getting ice cream on his face in &quot;Witness.&quot;\n\nWell, the structure itself isn&apos;t anything new. And if you&apos;ve seen a redemption story, you know what follows. But Mark Wahlberg does an exceptional job getting into the attitude of Stu. In a wild universe, he is Dirk Diggler grown up and trying to find salvation. Mirroring him is Mel Gibson, who plays his father who has his own moment of goodness. It&apos;s not much, but it is enough.\n\nYes, there are a few moments that get heavy handed. That&apos;s not to say, these things didn&apos;t occur in real life. Stu is brash, and edgy and punch-drunk dumb. He goes with the theory that he doesn&apos;t know until someone tells him it&apos;s wrong, then he doubles down. His logic is that if Christ wanted him alive, it must be that he wants him to double down for him.\n\nI&apos;ve no doubt that director Ross, whom is in a relationship with Mel Gibson, tapped the lighter side of the situation. In different hands, this plays as a broad parody. This was reigned in enough for it to hit where it needs to. Speaking of which...Jackie Weaver is such a blessing to watch. She embraces dialogue that would fall flat coming out of most actors&apos; mouths and hits the right beats. Completely nails the humor beats without knowing she is funny. She is the quintessential White trash mom with a kind heart. She has a lot of darkness in her, but they do such a brilliant thing...and not make that the centralized burden to her life. She presses forward and referees two bulls. Though she is separated from her husband Mel, she harbors the right degree of resentment to a former relationship. The dynamics of their family are very clear.\n\nAny way, this is a surprisingly funny flick. I found myself laughing many times at some of the absurdity that occurs. Special shout-out to Teresa Ruiz who plays the love interest. She is warm, kind and when things go wrong, does exhibit the proper reaction and emotions. She is fantastic in this!\n\nGo check it out. I think you&apos;re going to be surprised.\n\nStick around for a hilarious scene during credits.",

When an injury ends his amateur boxing career, Stuart Long moves to L.A. dreaming of stardom. While scraping by as a supermarket clerk, he meets Carmen, a Catholic Sunday school teacher who seems immune to his bad-boy charm. Determined to win her over, the longtime agnostic starts going to church to impress her. But surviving a terrible motorcycle accident leaves him wondering if he can use his second chance to help others find their way, leading to the surprising realization that he is meant to be a Catholic priest. Despite a devastating health crisis and the skepticism of Church officials and his estranged parents, Stu pursues his vocation with courage and compassion, inspiring not only those closest to him but countless others along the way."

            "reviewBody": "A film with the scope of James Cameron&apos;s Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today&apos;s economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.\n\nAvatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.\n\nRelative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na&apos;vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.\n\nAvatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.\n\n9.5/10",

I&apos;ll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don&apos;t think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I&apos;m seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don&apos;t as a rule. Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.",

I hope not, this is a childrens movie after all.\n\nJim Carrey really relishes and dives into his evil character! He has quite the fun with him and a lot of interesting zingers/one liners. This is overall a funny and entertaining little movie. Is it flawed? For sure - should you care though? The movie won&apos;t be fun if you do! Now that does not mean that the studio doesn&apos;t listen! The first trailer had quite the catastrophic reactions from fans all over the world ... so back to the drawing board (I guess almost literally) and a new improved Sonic was developed ... nicely done! So sit back, relax and enjoy the ride (that has quite a few plot holes in it, but a lot of heart too)",

Willem Dafoe was underused, I didn&apos;t think the support cast had the same quality material as Bale.\n\nThe photography is stylish, very 80s gloss!\n\nThe direction is terrific, wonderful camera work.\n\nOverall, see it, it&apos;s satire, black comedy, social commentary and more!"

            "name": "An overlong behind the scenes comedy for the COVD era that sports a few amusing moments, but not to the standards of the cast and crew",
            "reviewBody": "Following the critical and box office failure of her vehicle, Jerusalem Uprising, Carol Cobb (Karen Gillan) returns to the dinosaur action franchise Cliff Beasts for the sixth installment. Due to the COVD pandemic production is set up in a &quot;bubble&quot; in England where Carol and the other actors will live together to prevent any infections. As producer Gavin (Peter Serafinowicz) impotently tries to rein in negative publicity, on set tensions, and vices of the cast, the initially planned three month shoot gets extended again and again.\n\nCliff Beasts is the latest film from director Judd Apatow who also writes the film alongside Pam Brady best known for her work with South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker on the first three seasons of South Park, South Park: Bigger, Longer, &amp; Uncut, as well as Team America: World Police. The COVD pandemic has inspired a number of films attempting to capitalize on the pandemic ranging from Steven Soderbergh&apos;s surprisingly good Kimi, to slapdash productions like Songbird and Locked, and bottom of the barrel schlock like Corona: Fear is a Virus or The Covid Killer, however comedies have yet to tap into the genre save for outliers like NBC&apos;s short lived Connected or Freeform&apos;s Love in the Time of Corona both of which didn&apos;t particularly resonate with audiences. I think because of the nature of the pandemic it&apos;s been difficult to put any sort of comedic spin on the material especially in regards to the real world insanity and stupidity that doesn&apos;t lend itself all that well to exaggeration. With a strong cast of comedians and noted creative forces behind the camera The Bubble is possibly the biggest COVD film we&apos;ve seen yet and has the makings of something truly insightful, but at a little over two hours long and filled with abrasive characters The Bubble has some moments of humor but as a whole doesn&apos;t come together.\n\nLike other comedies that have attempted to approach the COVD pandemic, Apatow runs into the issue of having to create comic chaos in a place where everything is very controlled and structured and that rigidity ends up working against the talents of the cast as there&apos;s long sequences where they&apos;re forced to be by themselves or maybe with one other person and we really don&apos;t get the best environment for creating comic friction. Karen Gillan is our lead Carol Cobb and she&apos;s a fine actress with a strong repertoire of work, but her main gimmick is basically just taking very casual abuse from the cast, crew, and even her boyfriend who dumps her over video conferencing and continues to live in her house with a random waitress. The worst thing you can do in a comedy is make us feel sorry for the characters and that&apos;s what happens as we for the most part as we watch relationships deteriorate and egos clash and you feel like you&apos;re trapped with these people with no escape. Eventually when the movie becomes a bonkers &quot;escape&quot; film in the final 20 minutes it becomes a little funnier and gets more energy, but after two hours it&apos;s too little too late and it doesn&apos;t make up for all the floundering gags and dead spots littered throughout the move. Even the Cliff Beasts sequences which parody the Jurassic World films (even down to using similar font) aren&apos;t all that funny or engaging and it doesn&apos;t feel like Apatow&apos;s approach to this kind of satire has evolved since 2008&apos;s Forgetting Sarah Marshall where he took a similar approach to cookie cutter crime procedurals with Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime. The Cliff Beasts segments aren&apos;t silly enough to be all that funny and they also never feel like a true approximation of the box office crap The Bubble is poking fun at, and frankly when you have serious blockbusters like Moonfall that are far more insane and funnier than anything in The Bubble it undercuts whatever satire might&apos;ve been attempted.\n\nThe Bubble is unfortunately not up to the standards of its talented cast and crew. While there are brief bits of comic insanity sprinkled throughout, they&apos;re undone by an overly long runtime and the restrictive nature of the premise so the movie never really fires off. Maybe if this had been framed as a mockumentary it could&apos;ve used the awkwardness and isolation more effectively, in fact the documentary film within a film Beasts of the Bubble looks like a much more entertaining film by comparison. Some good moments, but not enough for me to recommend it.",

It is all about female pleasure and friendship of the modern man. \n\nIt is about supporting each other in times of need and cheering each other on, it&apos;s about finding your true self, it&apos;s about fighting and being friends again, it&apos;s about being comfortable with closeness and being open with emotions, it&apos;s about having sex and being friends, it&apos;s about finding the right one, it&apos;s about empowering women and their desires, it&apos;s about women of all skin colors, sizes and ages, it&apos;s about having a good time.\n\nI went to see the first movie with no expectations and really liked it, especially that it had some darker themes. The sequel is very different and much more of a &quot;feel-good movie&quot; and I don&apos;t just like it, I love it. When I went to see this movie, no one left the theater disappointed. \n\nChanning Tatum saw the trend that women do want sex and devour media even if it&apos;s trash (50 shades obviously), because there&apos;s nothing else out there. He gave us a movie that celebrates women, and men who are open-minded and supportive. Magic Mike XXL is very much a product of its time in the best possible way. If this is what it feels like to get channinged all over my tatum, I gladly want more."

Pretty soon the two are trying to get away from the cop as well as two drug lords in the middle of a war. As far as pot comedies goes this one here is nearly the best the small genre has to offer. I&apos;m sure Cheech and Chong would give this thing two bongs up as it does contain plenty of laughs but I couldn&apos;t help but feel it had the same shortcomings as other Judd Apatow movies. That one issue with this film, as well as the others, is that it runs too long for its own good. Clocking in a nearly two-hours I couldn&apos;t help but feel that the film could have lost thirty-minutes and not much would have been missed. This is especially true during the ending shoot out, which just keeps going and going. Outside of that issue this film contains some great big laughs with most of them coming in the form of pot jokes and stuff dealing with stoners. Seth Rogan turns in another winning performance as he gains plenty of laughs from his older guy. James Franco is the real jewel in the film as he&apos;s dead-on perfect as the drug dealing loser who just sits around his house getting high, selling pot and watching reruns on television. Franco gets the look down just right but his facial gestures and voice tone perfectly capture that pot head many of us have met in our lives. I thought Perez was pretty much wasted in a thankless role that didn&apos;t offer her too much to do. Ed Begley, Jr. has a funny bit as Rogan&apos;s girlfriend&apos;s father. The screenplay really doesn&apos;t offer us any jokes we haven&apos;t seen countless times before and in many ways there&apos;s not an original idea here but that doesn&apos;t really matter because the performances are what makes the movie funny."

The film is hugely atmospheric, moody and tense, it is visually fantastic, with great scenery and costumes. The story unfolds cleverly, when I think of witches, this is what comes to mind, as opposed to the more conventional. As you watch you never quite know what&apos;s coming next, or who the malign force truly is. Some truly unsettling and disturbing scenes, it&apos;s not a horror in the conventional sense, the scares are not cheap, but very poignant. Very good performance from the cast, Ralph Inseson and Kate Dickie in particular. On occasion the dialogue sounded a little flat, but it was in keeping with the setting of the movie.\n\nVery watchable.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...&quot;\n\nPre review:\n\nIts writing started in January 1973, &quot;eight hours a day, five days a week&quot;, George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThen, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was &quot;too strange&quot;.\n\nSuddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas&apos; genius. And that&apos;s how Star Wars became a reality.\n\nThe shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn&apos;t stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...\n\nReview:\n\nStar Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...\n\nOne of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick&apos;s revolutionary masterpiece: &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.\n\nThe story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer&apos;s desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel &quot;in distress&quot;, a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.\n\nThe film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.\n\nThe visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic &quot;filtered look&quot; so he kept changing key lights for a &quot;flashing&quot; effect. He used a loose, &quot;nervous&quot; frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.&quot; This is authenticity is reflected in it&apos;s most iconic shot: the &apos;Binary Sunset&apos; sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke&apos;s character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.\n\nBooks such as &quot;The hero with a thousand faces&quot; by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa&apos;s storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang&apos;s it&apos;s iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it&apos;s soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.\n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "I never had any intention of watching &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;) in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.\n\nAnastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I&apos;m sorry but there&apos;s no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she&apos;s doing, hasn&apos;t prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she&apos;s drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he&apos;s not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He&apos;s incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says &quot;If you were mine, you wouldn&apos;t be able to sit down for a week&quot;. In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he&apos;d paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she&apos;ll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&amp;M relationship...and that&apos;s when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it&apos;s of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn&apos;t want to be close to anyone...and he doesn&apos;t even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.\n\nWhat I find so bizarre about the whole &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN&apos;T any romance...and he doesn&apos;t want to date her. It&apos;s not so much just the S&amp;M aspects that I found bothersome...it&apos;s more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn&apos;t home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it&apos;s supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.\n\nSo although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn&apos;t like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. \n\nI should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn&apos;t find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn&apos;t come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you&apos;d like...I just didn&apos;t particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull.",

It&apos;s lack of scariness(non existent) and *GASP!* gore is more than made up for with the constant flow of hilarity and likable characters. This is by far the optimist&apos;s zombie film, as the way things play out are definitely different than any one thats come before it(definitely not a Romero flick, though I think his Land of the Dead actually is second place in this regard). It has a sleek, very modern sense of style-just watch for how each rule makes it&apos;s appearance/reappearance and a good message on the importance of others in the worst of times. I recommend this to anybody who has a remote interest in comedies, zombie/end of the world flicks, or just having a good time at the theater, and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out.",

A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn&apos;t.\n\nI gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn&apos;t long enough for me. I would like to see a director&apos;s cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.\n\nI had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I&apos;ll never forget."
