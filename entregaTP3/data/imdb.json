I was in cloud 9 especially at the very beginning of the movie with its impressive visuals and intense, insane action. I haven&apos;t seen of all MCU but I&apos;m very familiar with their usual formula or story structure. Into the Multiverse of Madness takes a more refreshing approach with a lot of brutality, felt pre-Disney era, and the humor felt right. Rami managed to added in some of his horror elements in there (Drag Me to Hell vibes) but I wanted more but I digress. The &quot;short&quot; runtime doesn&apos;t feel short, it&apos;s evenly paced out with no rushed moments (I recommend watching or rewatching WandaVision prior). Obviously, Cumberbatch and especially Olsen stole the show with their masterly performances. And last but not least, the amazing, Sam Rami god I miss him and his unique but amazing craft. Appreciate the movie for what it is and not with your expectations.",

            "reviewBody": "It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.\n\nObviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.\n\nOh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He&apos;s older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh&apos;s baby daddy in this joint.\n\nLast and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that&apos;s what you do when you have legends do your flick.\n\nSpeaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.\n\nThe fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that&apos;s about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What&apos;s even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh&apos;s daughter looks like she&apos;s possibly in her early 20s. Don&apos;t know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)\n\nThe music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she&apos;s going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I&apos;m watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!\n\nI say it&apos;s good. It&apos;s all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll be honest, The Bad Guys is far from masterpieces like Pixar&apos;s Up, Wall-E, and the plot is rather predictable. But who am I kidding, almost all animations are predictable since they&apos;re made for kids so that shouldn&apos;t be a problem, as long as they&apos;re enjoyable. Fortunately for The Bad Guys, now I wouldn&apos;t say the movie &apos;nailed it&apos;, but it turned out to be pretty decent.\n\nSo the main characters are really likeable (pretty cute I would say), the voice acting is great (Sam Rockwell is wonderful, his voice is just so magnetic. Beetz&apos;s Diane is wonderful too.) Wolf and Fox have an amazing chemistry (I love the pair), and the characters&apos; interactions are executed rather well, the storytelling pace is smooth and the motives are clear and believable, so there won&apos;t be any scenes that feel off, forced or awkward (Except for the opening car chase, that part is over the top, that I agree with Foxinton. And personally I hate this &apos;talking to viewers&apos; thing, movies should be immersive! &apos;Show, not tell.&apos; Isn&apos;t that what you writers prefer?) (I do like the opening scene though, kinda like Pulp Fiction, but in a reletively-terribly-written way. But I don&apos;t blame the writers for this, I mean, they&apos;re not Quentin, are they? It&apos;s just an animation.) Hats off to the writer/director, they&apos;ve done a great job on this.\n\nNow what I like most about The Bad Guys is that it doesn&apos;t try to give a lecture, it doesn&apos;t try to convey any messages (not anything big or meaningful at least, heh.) Disney and Pixar would be like &apos;Ohh! We should add messages into animations, we should teach kids about what&apos;s right and wrong, we should use animations as a way to express our political beliefs.&apos; No, The Bad Guys just tries to entertain people, and it did rather well. I&apos;m not saying that I hate messages in an animation, I love meaningful and educational animations, but only when the story is great. It seems to me that some animations focus on &apos;the big message&apos; so much that they forget the fact that a well-written story should come first. No matter how true or how important your message is, nobody would like your animation if the story is bad. The Bad Guys does a good job on this by not giving any lecture. It knows what it is, it knows it can&apos;t be as good as animations like Inside Out, which is both entertaining and educational, so it chooses to only entertain. And judging by the result, it really did a good job.",

            "reviewBody": "An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I&apos;m quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth&apos;s character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn&apos;t have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn&apos;t watch it again, but I certainly didn&apos;t mind watching it. It isn&apos;t the most memorable, but I certainly don&apos;t have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.\n\nMy Rating: 5.8/10.",

Combined with the passion and love brought to screen with Johnny Depp&apos;s acting in this role - as well as the rest of the cast - I certainly imagine Hunter raising a glass to the entire cast and crew with a big smirk on his beautiful, weathered face.

            "reviewBody": "36/100\n\nUncharted is Sony&apos;s latest attempt to fit an acclaimed franchise with 42 hours of content and story into just 2... Make your own judgment from that.\n\nIt&apos;s funny to think that, no matter how hard you try, these days you cannot adapt a video game into a film, and vice versa. While one tries to be as efficient as possible with his limited time, the other can pack as much information as it can in order to become more extensive or ambitious.\n\nThis indicates that, even if someone has the courage to adapt something like the Uncharted series to the big screen, whether they wanted to or not, they must summarize, or flatly ignore, certain plot points to prioritize others. The problem is that this selection process has such a complex naturalness that, with a single mistake, it can feel like the film is trying to contextualize as much as it can, ignoring not to feel overwhelming.\n\nEven if that is your purpose, you have to be subtle. Uncharted binned that advice completely.\n\nFrom European villains to straight up pirate ships, Uncharted feels like one of the least ambitious popcorn flicks I&apos;ve come across in quite some time.\n\nThe plot seems to have been invented while the filming process of the film was being executed, which would not surprise me at this point if it were true, while clinging to the mediocrity of the actors&apos; work. The same ones who clearly did not want to be part of the film in the first place.",

Beginning with an unnecessary and inaccurate WW1 prologue then shifting to a London &quot;jazz&quot; club with cringe dancing (which Poirot wouldn&apos;t be seen dead in) presumably to up the diversity quota. By the time the story gets to Egypt in a very fake pyramid scene I was getting wary. Then to a preposterously fake Nile-side hotel with a French and Saunders double act (I kid you not) and some dreadful dialogue. Then the band from the jazz club appeared (no, really). At this point my willingness to suspend my disbelief was no longer willing and TV was switched off.\n\nLook, it might have got better after this but I&apos;m afraid Mr B lost this particular member of the audience before the first reel ended. The story is well known, the Peter Ustinov and David Suchet adaptations were classy, capturing the spirit of the book and the age. This version is an overblown, inaccurate historical fairy story to pander to attention deprived millennials; all visual key jangling without the style of the age or the class of the original writing. This is a good example of how films are nowadays turning a classic book with a pedigree of film adaptations into something unwatchable. Shame on you Mr B.",

It&apos;s much bigger but feels just like the first movie. It&apos;s on par with the original in every way, just bigger.\n\nI said this in my review of the first movie, every moment Jim Carrey is on the screen is pure gold. I wanted him to be in every scene. His facial expressions are hilarious. Whoever cast him as Robotnik is a genius. It&apos;s so perfect. I can&apos;t imagine it being anyone else.\n\nMy only downsides are a few parts that don&apos;t really make sense. I chalked it up to being a kids movie but that&apos;s not really an excuse. And was I the only one who thought Idris Elba was doing something weird with Knuckles&apos; accent? It sounded like it was switching between an English accent and a heavy New York accent, and sometimes a combination of both. I couldn&apos;t stop hearing it.\n\nI had a great time with this movie. Two out of two in the videogame genre??? That&apos;s unheard of. Keep up the good work. Maybe this is the tide turning on video game movies like it did with superhero movies in the early 2000&apos;s. I can only hope. (1 viewing, opening night 4/8/2022)",

            "reviewBody": "Nick Cage: &quot;Is that supposed to be me? It&apos;s ... grotesque.&quot;\n\nThe unbelievable part of The Unbelievable Weight of Immense Talent is that it&apos;s all true (in a figurative way). Nicolas Cage can play himself, Nick Cage, because the many films he&apos;s been in, some worthwhile (Moonstruck, Raising Arizona, Face/Off) and some terrible (take your pick), have prepared him for a true meta experience, like John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich or the cast playing themselves in Robert Altman&apos;s The Player.\n\nOf course, it&apos;s hilarious because Cage is usually a witty version of himself and making fun of himself anyway (except when he wins the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas). With the help of director Tom Gormican and writer Kevin Etten, Unbearable is a metanarrative of Nick as a burgeoning hero for his daughter, Addy (Lily Sheen), and a buddy for a drug kingpin, Avi (Pedro Pascal), with whom he writes a joke thriller, which Unbearable turns out to be.\n\nPascal&apos;s performance as a thorough Cage fan and possible drug lord emphasizes the often-close emotional bond between fans, star, and film. There is little difference between us and Avi in our love for the actor and his roles.\n\nThroughout this comedy, the art of filmmaking turns out to take center screen as the principals dog out a workable script that they really are starring in here, more or less because the fusion of art and life is blurred. The varied facets of filmmaking and the actor&apos;s relationship with his audience are never far from the surface. Nor is it stagnant because each Cage film is a mirror for Hollywood&apos;s immediate needs and its actor&apos;s. In Unbearable Nick&apos;s striving for the &quot;part of a lifetime,&quot; never far from a clichÃ©.\n\nFor Nicolas Cage, such is his life, and the film makes fun of his accepting roles solely for getting cash to pay his bills, and maybe, just maybe, for the joy of acting, for which he&apos;s indicted when he loses the people closest to him because of his obsession for acting.\n\nAs Cage plays himself, he stumbles on the right script to reconcile him with his family and win the admiration of his audience. He&apos;s never far from his Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas or a &quot;should-have-been-nominated&quot; in Pig. A good will pervades this complex comedy, largely because Cage has a good heart hidden underneath his thespian ambitions, real or fictional."

            "reviewBody": "Though the style part was enjoyable on it&apos;s own; the cinematography, special effects, costumes, score, set design and much of the acting was brilliant. It felt great to lose myself into the feel of the wizarding world again. But the plot and the writing felt unanchored in anything real or relatable. Nothing felt earned. Events just happened without much anticipation or appreciation of their significance, and I didn&apos;t feel invested much in any of the plot lines or characters. I&apos;m not expert enough to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but I know something did.",

You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.\n\nJohn Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. \n\nThe story of one man&apos;s reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.\n\nDo not miss this film!",

Checked the director - Bay.\n\nBingo.\n\nThen everything made perfect sense. Thirty-minute-long actions scenes with insane camera work - check. Surreal decision-making in a world that operates in Grand Theft Auto V logic - check. Blatant mockery of politically relevant topics - check.\n\nI can enjoy a Bay film, I love the Rock, and it&apos;s very similar. But this one is of complete insanity. It&apos;s so incredibly over the top you can&apos;t even see the top from here.\n\nAnd then Bay tries to do drama, and of course, it&apos;s excruciating.\n\nThere&apos;s no reason to try to understand the story since it exists only in this nightmare world where everyone is aggressive, careless, stupid, and has no regard for their or others&apos; lives.\n\nPros: some decent action scenes and excellent acting by Gyllenhaal.\n\nCons: it&apos;s a nightmare.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s a solid live adaptation of a GTA V five-star car chase but with no tanks.",

This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.\n\n8/10",

You can tell that the writers have spent a lot of time on sapphic Ao3 because they nail every beloved trope perfectly.\n\nThe cast is wonderful as well. Auli&apos;i Cravalho is a revelation. I have rarely seen someone representing pining so well Mega Mullaly is hilarious and plays such an amazing mom. Rowan Blanchard does a fine job of playing a gay mess\n\nAn especially great thing is that there is zero homophobia in this movie. Not unlike Schitt&apos;s Creek queer people here are just allowed to be without having to constantly represent the everyday day they face\n\nOf course this movie is not for anyone. It&apos;s meant for the queer community and if you are not part of it a lot of it might go over your head or make you angry(the way several borderline homophobic reviews have already shown).",

            "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. It&apos;s not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that&apos;s because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, &quot;The best stories are rooted in reality.&quot;\n\nOscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a &apos;wink and a nod&apos; to Fabio). Loretta&apos;s love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she&apos;s required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.\n\nAfter their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He&apos;s read her latest book and needs her help in locating the &apos;Crown of Fire&apos; hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he&apos;s more than a pretty face. Loretta&apos;s stressed out literary agent Beth (Da&apos;Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).\n\nIt&apos;s regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt&apos;s cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta&apos;s rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It&apos;s mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (&quot;The Office&quot;).\n\nSandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It&apos;s an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It&apos;s meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It&apos;s totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.\n\nOpening in theaters on March 25, 2022.",

            "reviewBody": "If there&apos;s ever proof of the cachet of Naval Aviation, this is it. Those poor Air Force guys got a trio of &quot;Iron Eagle&quot; flicks that went from bad to horrible, whereas the Navy flyboys got this great 1980&apos;s classic. Sure, it&apos;s cheesy and corny, but it makes the cheese and corn taste pretty damn good. A cynic might argue that it&apos;s just a two hour long Navy recruiting ad (one that worked for me, two years later I found my ass in Pensacola sweating through AOCS, short for Aviation Officer Candidate School, the program immortalized in &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;) but by making a pro-Navy movie, the filmmakers also got invaluable technical assistance from top Navy aviators, and it shows.\n\nFor starters, although this movie takes numerous liberties in order to entertain, the basic setup, in which fighter pilots from the fleet get sent to NAS Miramar, aka, &quot;Top Gun&quot; for intensive training, is 100% accurate. The Navy, back during Vietnam, was getting sick of losing too many pilots in air-to-air combat. The problem, they discovered, was their fighter jocks had been trained for purely long-range missile interceptions, meaning they&apos;d lost their dogfighting skills. And, in Vietnam, several American planes were accidentally shot down by their own side by missiles, so, as a safety factor, enemy planes had to be visually identified, meaning American pilots were back to engaging the enemy at short range, hence the need for dogfighting. The &quot;Top Gun&quot; school was started as a result, and the rest is history.\n\nNow, back to the movie. Tom Cruise is Maverick, a hotshot pilot but also somewhat unstable. If &quot;Risky Business&quot; launched his career as a movie star, then &quot;Top Gun&quot; cemented it. Guys wanted to be like him, and women of course lusted after him. The plot is pure formula, but executed with consummate professionalism. The team who put this movie together knew exactly how to push all the right buttons. But the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me is surely the flying. I don&apos;t think that any movie, before or since, has ever rendered air combat in a more convincing and dramatic fashion. For nearly 100 years fighter pilots have been the modern equivalent of olden knights, men who brought a sense of glamour and romance to the deadly art of war, and this movie gives them a fitting tribute.\n\n8/10"

Back on earth, he is betrayed by fellow astronaut Jocinda Fowler (Halle Berry) and gets blamed for human error. It&apos;s ten years later. Brian is a shell of himself. Conspiracy theorist KC Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that the moon&apos;s orbit is deteriorating and headed for earth. He tries to recruit Brian to contact NASA.\n\nDirector Roland Emmerich has woven a conspiracy theory into his brand of action sci-fi thriller. I like the potential. I even like the outlandish concept. The first half is a little clunky but I&apos;m willing to go with it. The problematic writing does build up over time. It&apos;s his never-ending close calls and melodramas. It&apos;s the awkward sci-fi. The second half stumbles here and there until it falls flat. Roland is no longer that guy anymore. He&apos;s not making the big budget action thriller hits.",

He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.\n\nI have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it&apos;s a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it&apos;s small duration didn&apos;t help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that &quot;Morbius&quot; is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.",

            "reviewBody": "You don&apos;t see many movies like this in theatres these days! And this is exactly why I loved it, it&apos;s the kind of film that I really miss seeing a lot of; they type that typically gets dumped on streaming these days. It&apos;s an old-fashioned crime thriller that takes place in one location and is a dialogue driven story... and believe it or not it&apos;s not part of a franchise! It&apos;s a very well done film and is certainly going to be one of the most underrated films of 2022. If you&apos;re reading this, don&apos;t sleep on it, go see it right away! I didn&apos;t even watch a trailer for it, I went in pretty much blind, and absolutely loved it! I ate it right up; it was a huge, pleasant surprise! It&apos;s a perfect classic day-in-the-life of a mobster tale!\n\nWriter-director Graham Moore really brings a Hitchcock frame of mind to this film. It takes place all in one location, has a small cast and yet could not be more intense and impressive! The script is immaculate, one of the best crime thriller scripts I&apos;ve seen in ages and feels like it actually has a high quality feel to it. There are so many awesome twists and turns throughout, and some truly electric dialogue. I also loved how it uses the concept of Chekhov&apos;s gun to cleverly setup and subvert expectations, it made the twists even more satisfying! Every time I thought I had the film figured out, it turned the tables on me, keeping me in suspense. Moore handles the suspense so well, in very Hitchcockian ways and the movie is constantly gripping, interesting and intense! However while the films abundance and reliance on its twists is its greatest strength, it&apos;s also its greatest flaw as it slightly pushed my suspension of disbelief a little far and messed with the pacing at times. But the pros far outweigh the cons. I also loved how cleverly Moore made use of the space (the tailor shop), which was immaculately and thoroughly utilized throughout. I was constantly surprised how they kept finding new ways to use the space and evolve the story! The only downside was that this didn&apos;t allow for the cinematography to be as impressive or eye popping as it could have been; it was good but not overly creative, just purely functional.\n\nAnother huge strength of the film is it&apos;s impressive cast and stellar performances! Mark Rylance kills it in this movie, he delivers such a daring and phenomenal performance as Leonard. It&apos;s incredibly nuanced and I just love how he slowly revealed more about his character through ways he behaved and slight tendencies in dialogue delivery. The story also really helped here, I loved how it slowly pulled back the curtain on the character as the film went on, and you couldn&apos;t help but root for him. Zoey Deutch was also such a surprise, she was so good in this, and Dylan O&apos;Brien and Johnny Flynn were also great and need to be in more stuff! All the acting in the film was incredible, it blew me away. The actors alongside the great script truly carry the film and are the reason I loved it as much as I did!\n\nThe Outfit isn&apos;t flashy, but it&apos;s a very solid story with a tightly tailored performance from Mark Rylance. It&apos;s perfect for fans of old-school thrillers; it&apos;s very well made and very enjoyable. Don&apos;t miss this one, it&apos;s rare we get films as special as this one these days!",

            "reviewBody": "Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it&apos;s as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won&apos;t say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven&apos;t seen it.\n\nThere aren&apos;t as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.\n\nI wasn&apos;t much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It&apos;s largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom&apos;s performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.\n\nBasically, it&apos;s a really fun movie and I&apos;d give it about 8 out of 10",

This time he plays a killer. But with morals. Oh and Alzheimers. That might explain why he keeps forgetting he used to star in award winning movies where he didn&apos;t have to play the worlds oldest action hero. When he refuses to do a job &apos;cause he has to kill a 13-year old girl (possibly using his AARP card) they send somebody else to do it and to knock off Liam too. Don&apos;t know why they bother when he&apos;s gonna cash it in from advanced old age soon anyway. So he hobbles his way through a bunch of so-so action scenes leaving a trail of dust, cobwebs, and empty Ben-gay tubes in his wake. He drives around with his left turn signal on, complains that his kids never call and can&apos;t understand why youngsters listen to that dam hippity-hop music. (Kidding) Other than that you&apos;ve pretty much seen all the rest in other, better movies with much, much younger, less wrinkly stars. But if you really want to see a creaky, moldy 70-year old guy kick some butt, go ahead and check it out. Four stars.",

            "reviewBody": "I hadn&apos;t heard about the 2020 &quot;Run&quot; from writers Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian prior to getting to sit down to watch it. I looked it up on IMDb just before watching it, hoping to get an idea what I was in for; so I read the synopsis for the movie, but not any reviews.\n\nNormally I am not one to watch an abundance of thrillers, because the genre tends to be pretty much a dime a dozen, but still with the chance given to sit down to watch this particular movie, I did so.\n\nAnd I will say that director Aneesh Chaganty definitely delivered an entertaining movie. The storyline presented in the movie was one that had me thoroughly entertained, and I enjoyed how the writers kept me in the dark, letting me guess as to what was really going on. And director Aneesh Chaganty managed to reveal more and more of the actual happenings in small bits and pieces, which definitely left me wanting for more, and it was such a good sensation when it dawns upon you what is actually happening.\n\n&quot;Run&quot; is a movie that is driven by some great acting performances by the two leads; that being Sarah Paulson (playing Diane, the mom) and Kiera Allen (playing Chloe, the disabled daughter). And since there weren&apos;t all that many people in the movie, the pressure of delivering was bigger for the leads, but they mustered this with excellence.\n\nThe build up of the storyline is good and keeps you wanting more, and I like how the director just gradually feeds you bits and pieces of the storyline, as it makes for a very intense movie.\n\nI was definitely entertained by &quot;Run&quot; and it is a movie that was well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. The ending of the movie, though, was just rubbish - pardon my bluntness here. But that ending was just ridiculous; and no, I am not revealing it, as you have to experience it yourself.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Run&quot; lands on a well-deserved six out of ten stars.",

They try to persuade the notoriously private rock music icon, Clay Calloway(Bono), to sing with them for a new musical, they&apos;re staging.\n\nSing 2 is a fun film. Director Garth Jennings has retained the feel-good spirit of Sing(2016) &amp; of course lots of new foot-tapping songs sung by our favorite stars. The original music by U2 lead singer Bono, is fantastic. The cast&apos;s voice-overs &amp; their singing, is the highlight of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as Buster Moon. Reese Witherspoon is spectacular as Rosita. Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as Ash. Tori Kelly is outstanding as Meena. Taron Egerton is phenomenal as Johnny. Bobby Cannavale is perfect as Mr. Crystal. Bono is excellent as Clay Calloway. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Sing 2 is a must watch, with your entire family. Go &amp; singalong with your favorite characters.",

Safin as child survived Madelein&apos;s father assassination of family; goes after her family as revenge. Bond visits Vesper Land&apos;s (a tie-in to earlier Bond tales) grave for an explosive beginning. Madelein Swann grows up to be a psychotherapist &amp; lover to Bond.\n\nInconsistencies: Young Madeleine shoots Safin four times in the chest yet he easily chases after her. She is small &amp; falls through lake ice yet many times heavier Safin does not.\n\nBelieved to be the final Craig Bond, but credit at the end says, &quot;James Bond will return.&quot; DVD offers insights into how the film was made; more interesting than the film itself.",

In some scenes, all the windows and doors in the house shook.\n\nLong story short, &apos;The Adam Project&apos; is a movie made to entertain the audience and it succeeds.",

It is unfortunate, that this movie will suffer because of the negative ratings that it will receive.\n\nBut at the same time, being an outsider.

One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.\n\n&quot;Eternals&quot; was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could&apos;ve been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don&apos;t know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute.",

Unfortunately the meticulous attention to image rather than screenplay (to me) resulted in a quite cold and un- engaging movie, where beautiful costumes, interiors and landscapes are the only highlights. I found that even the acting of the brilliant young Eddie Redmayne was not that good, as his constant smiles and shy blinking eyes after a while seem to be the only stratagem he has to portray such a complex character (and after the first dozen of them I couldn&apos;t stand it anymore). A more sophisticated psychological portrait of the main character and a more dramatic rendition of his/her troubled soul would have given more solidity to a movie which seems too superficial.",

There is an attempt at strong characterization as Mei learns to be independent and learns the value of her independence. But it comes across as hollow because from the film&apos;s opening scene she says that she takes pride in being independent. So, there&apos;s no change in values for her. She just becomes more outspoken.\n\nAlso, I found the movie rather distasteful in that it seems to encourage rebelling against your parents because they&apos;ll never understand you, as opposed to appreciating what they do for you and having honest, open two-way communication with them.\n\nLastly, good gracious this is one of the most cringe-inducing films I&apos;ve ever seen. The writing and dialogue often comes across as a horribly dated Disney channel movie from 2002. The movie is loud, anxious, and obnoxious for almost the entirety of its runtime.\n\nThis is Pixar&apos;s first true misstep since Cars 2. I guess they can do wrong.",

And as if changes to her interests, relationships and body weren&apos;t enough, whenever she gets too excited (which is practically ALWAYS), she &quot;poofs&quot; into a giant red panda!"

I&apos;ve seen Michelle Williams look beautiful and amazingly desirable. None of these feature in Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\n\nInstead you get a constant gay married couple bickering between Venom and Brock which is supposed to be insightful and funny, but isn&apos;t, a cardboard psychopathic villain that could have been sympathetic with just a few edits, a pointless villain girlfriend that has no influence on the plot of the film whatsoever, even though she has a superpower she is inconsequential, a pointless hero girlfriend who is there just to be a damsel in distress, copy pasted from the bad Spiderman films, a policeman who is there just to be the always late to the joke guy and... Dan? Who cares about Dan?! I swear the most interesting character in this film is the mean Chinese lady at the store. There is no chemistry between any of the characters. None!\n\nBut the worse problem is that there is no story, no tension, nothing to solve. The interaction between hero and villain is minimal yet stretching imagination and both their paths when separate are boring uninteresting bad writing.\n\nEven the CGI fights feel pointless, as two blobs fight each other by hitting and throwing each other. Venom knows ALL the weaknesses of a symbiont and does nothing with it. Brock knows his symbiont and does nothing with it.\n\nThe more I write in this review the more stars disappear from the rating, so I will just stop. This could have been the exact same movie with ten times less budget, cheap CGI and unknown actors. No one would have noticed a difference. And there is one end credits scene that is more interesting in its implications than the entire movie!! Ugh.",

The song We Don&apos;t talk about Bruno is the worst. The reason is that the songs were long and repetitive and there basically used as a vehicle to take up empty plot space not add anything of value to scene. Speaking if the plot, it just wasn&apos;t well thought out. I feel that instead of rushing this film they should have spent time working on the script and music. This voice actors were excellent. I just think children deserved better than a beautiful film with mediocre plot and songs.",

The newest addition to the franchise tries something new but - while there are for sure some good aspects - tastes like a bad mixed cocktail: the ingredients (or parts) just don&apos;t work too well together. The King&apos;s Man: no fail but compared to Kingsman: The Secret Service this one is just another rather weak entry.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;Is it a beast, or is it a man? You&apos;re in luck, because tonight, you will see him feed! Come on in and find out. Is he a man... or beast?&quot; Clem Hoatley (Willem Dafoe)\n\nThere&apos;s not much a filmmaker can do to destroy the interest audiences have remaking the film-noir genre: the corruptible good guy, the seductive femme fatale, the dark alleys, the glitzy gates to hell represented by carnival shows, murder, and morally-diseased humanity. All these are staples and of enduring appeal to audiences titillated by seeing the dark side.\n\nIs there room for a better noir in remake? Case in point: Nightmare Alley-directed by a cinematic magician, Guillermo del Toro-adds a colorful canvas of sideshow splendor, occupied by Felliniesque carnies and specimens, taking money and goodness from gullible audiences, frequently rubes but occasionally swells who left their scruples back in their estates.\n\nBradley Cooper joins Bogey, Mitcham, and the many other actors who played flawed heroes like gifted grifter Stanton Carlisle. He joins the carnival to have a roof and food. He discovers his talent for illusion, be it sending electricity through his innocent assistant Molly (Rooney Mara) or bilking wealthy widowers like sinner Ezra Grindle (Richard Jenkins).\n\nIt is a joy to watch the charismatic lead descend into the hell of deceit by misdirection just as it is to see wealthy head Dr. Lilith Ritter (Cate Blanchette) perform the femme fatale duties icy with class and charm. Together they fleece the wealthy so completely that some take to suicide after losing everything including their sanity.\n\nVisually Nightmare Alley is a feast of colorful set design (it is a carnival after all) and perfectly modulated light to make you feel you are there at the beginning of WWII. The world is in turmoil for a beast who will murder millions. As Nightmare Alley shows, Hitler is not the only beast roaming who could as well be Stan, our man: &quot;I am prepared to offer you folks one last chance to witness this supreme oddity. Where did it come from? ... gone wrong somehow in maternal womb. Not fit for living.&quot; Clem\n\nNightmare Alley is a pleasure to see and hear but a reminder that humankind&apos;s ability to foster evil is eternal, albeit fascinating."

            "reviewBody": "Bottom line is that All the Old Knives is a really fine and absorbing movie. I recommend it, no hesitation. The rest of what I have to say about it just fills in details.\n\nSpy thrillers on the screen seem to fall into two categories. The first and by far the most numerous is the James Bond path: fill the screen with action and when in doubt, add in more car chases, hand-to-hand fights, and explosions. These efforts can be extremely well done and give you a great thrill ride and if that&apos;s what you want, there&apos;s no lack of choices out there. But the generic problem with those was nicely nailed by that very wise writer Ursula Le Guin: if the only thing going on is unceasing physical action, that&apos;s a sure sign no story is being told. (Or words to that effect -- I had trouble finding the exact quote.)\n\nSo then we have the second category: the John LeCarre camp. Much rarer and ultimately more interesting. Sylistically the daddy of all of these is The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965, starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom). All the Old Knives is spookily close to a modern version of that. Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton play now-retired intelligence officers tasked with getting to the bottom of an 8-year-old unsolved mystery: what went wrong with the way their agency dealt with the infamous Flight 127 in Vienna, taken over and destroyed by terrorists? Was their a mole among them, and who? The story gets laid out for us in flashbacks and replays of their memories (and sometimes flashbacks within the flashbacks), bit by bit.\n\nHere&apos;s a spoiler for free: there&apos;s not a SINGLE car chase, fight, or explosion. Not one. (There is one gunshot.) This is grittier, realer, and tenser. If you think this is boring -- here, have a lollipop. Go away and let the grownups watch it.\n\nThe two stars Pine and Newton virtually carry the whole movie, with a bit of help from veterans Laurence Fishburne and Jonathan Pryce in supporting roles. But they are all excellent and the dialog is impressively realistic, constantly engaging. Following the twists and turns is not meant to be easy, I think, but the scenes connect seamlessly and flow beautifully. Is there a message underneath it all? It&apos;s never said out loud, but I think it is just that in this spy business, everybody taking part -- sooner or later, right side or wrong side -- loses. Be prepared to have a mix of feelings by the end.",

            "reviewBody": "I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I&apos;m sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can&apos;t do that, since that isn&apos;t my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you&apos;re a fan of J.K. Rowling&apos;s magical world. \n\nFor starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. \n\nThe creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it&apos;s more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they&apos;re all filled with personality. The sequences when they&apos;re catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. \n\nHowever there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There&apos;s also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn&apos;t that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. \n\nStill these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It&apos;s filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn&apos;t flawless by any means it&apos;s certainly entertaining!",

            "reviewBody": "I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that&apos;s because I admit this film&apos;s faults. It certainly isn&apos;t near perfect but I felt very moved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be able to relate to this film however those of us that do can say that everything about this depiction of love has been experienced and is real. As a grown single adult living in today&apos;s dating world I can attest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Their obsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep and possibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Love sometimes doesn&apos;t make sense and can&apos;t be described or made logical. Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness and despair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it&apos;s represented on. So many times have I given myself up for something that a year later I looked back on and couldn&apos;t reconcile my behavior, and so many times have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before it completely devoured me. I don&apos;t know if I have been in love, but I have felt what these characters are going through and I wouldn&apos;t know what else to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier I think Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes the acting isn&apos;t great and yes the story is dry, but it&apos;s a genuine take on what relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties to early thirties and I loved every second of it.",

So when Harley Quinn come back for the third time I don&apos;t have high expectations. No offense to Margot Robbie, her performance is great but the story from both movie is just not that good.\n\nAnd enter James Gunn, this man totally change the game. This movie is way better than two other DC movies that I mentioned above. It is fun, full of action, and surprisingly gory. Something that I didn&apos;t expect before.\n\nThe story still follow the same pattern. Convicted criminals with special powers were given the task to save the day. This time there are more characters introduced than before. I personally like the character King Shark, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. The chemistry between fatherly figure Bloodsport (Idris Elba) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) is so good here.\n\nI like the comedy here, so chaotic. The CGI is believable, the action is cool, and as I said before, it&apos;s gory. So many blood splattered, body dismembered, throat cut, they&apos;re not for those with weak stomach for sure. I just wish there&apos;s more explanation in the end of the movie. But other than that, it&apos;s a good movie.",

When an injury ends his amateur boxing career, Stuart Long moves to L.A. dreaming of stardom. While scraping by as a supermarket clerk, he meets Carmen, a Catholic Sunday school teacher who seems immune to his bad-boy charm. Determined to win her over, the longtime agnostic starts going to church to impress her. But surviving a terrible motorcycle accident leaves him wondering if he can use his second chance to help others find their way, leading to the surprising realization that he is meant to be a Catholic priest.

Leonardo Di Caprio? I think not.\n\nHow would Mary Harron deal with those controversial torture scenes?\n\nWhat we got was one of the finest movies I have seen for some time. Of course, those of closed minds will slate this film without even bothering to see it, simply because of the book&apos;s notoriety.\n\nI was impressed to see how closely Harron followed the book, replacing the un-filmable seens with suggestion, aka ear-cutting scene from resevior dogs, so that you believe you have seen more than you have. There are more parallels with Tarantino, such as the use of classic (&amp; non classic ) 80&apos;s pop to create a stylised feel to the movie, that has not been seen since Pulp Fiction.\n\nCasting was superb, with Cristian Bale giving the performance of a lifetime, We, the audience, saw the souless monster within, Batemans superficial aquaintences, saw another faceless human being.\n\nJust like the book, you are never sure wether Batemans crimes are real, or just imaginary, but his slide into insanity is clearly real and paced expertly by Bale.\n\nRheese Witherspoon as Evelyn was disappointing, &quot;Election&quot; showed what a great actress she is and although this role called for an airhead performance, it was clear that she was cruising.\n\nMary Harron deserves the credit for creating an excellent film, that could have so easily been just another slasher movie."

I usually enjoy Judd Apatow&apos;s low-brow comedies, but this one reminds us of everything we hated about the early stages of the pandemic with added celebrity commentary. The humor didn&apos;t land for me most of the time, and even with a spectacular cast, the film never hits the highs you expect. It just gets by with a meandering screenplay that neither engages nor makes us root for any of its whiny, privileged characters. Well, Apatow&apos;s trying otherwise - he wants us to laugh at (and not with) everyone in the film industry dominated by corporate giants and larger-than-life characters. The pandemic was a bad phase, and no films needed to be made around that subject. Some fleeting flourishes aside (mostly from Pedro Pascal and a few cameos), The Bubble is honestly a letdown!",

Without getting into the spoilers, the pop culture references work better than expected. The only complaint I have is the streamer cameos were kind of dumb and they spent way too much time with them. Besides that Free Guy is a great popcorn movie and I highly recommend it!",

            "reviewBody": "Let me first say, this is not a &quot;bad&quot; movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn&apos;t like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn&apos;t appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you.",

For the most part this is a road trip movie and that&apos;s about it.\n\nThere&apos;s no real storyline here, no interesting side bars, zero character development, the dialogue is long, meandering and hard to follow (actually I think they made it up as they went along.)\n\nThere are a couple of cool dance sequences, but no choreographed routines or stripping per se just dance moves (or singing) and aggressive man handling of female spectators. Joe Manganiello does a very sexy act towards the end and I also liked the 30 seconds Channing bumps and grinds in his workshop while attempting to get his groove back and that&apos;s about it.",

            "name": "Vibrant, hilarious mesh of genres, and a different sort of film for David Gordon Green",
            "reviewBody": "There will be many who will dismiss &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; as immature, overly silly, disjointed, and scatter-shot. There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful, playful, loose genre-bending comedy with some outstanding performances, an inspired comedy script, and some great work from director David Gordon Green, certainly one of the finest young directors around.\n\nThe latter group is correct. &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; is, as a whole, the best movie the Apatow clan has produced yet. David Gordon Green is unquestionably the best director to direct one of these movies, but this is also a very different sort of movie than the films he usually directs. Does he rise to the challenge? He certainly does. I never would have believed that he was capable of directing such exciting and fun action scenes, or keep the movie&apos;s tone steady despite the different elements it consists of being so wildly disparate, but somehow he pulls it off. No other stoner movie can claim to be as artful and well-directed as this film.\n\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg&apos;s much-anticipated follow-up to &quot;Superbad&quot; is an excellent screenplay, but expect none of the realism and resonance of that film; &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; is all about the laughs, and the laughs are certainly here, and they are practically non-stop, with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue, acting, or the sort of incredible sight gag this movie does so well. This is just great comedy throughout. \n\nIn addition to David Gordon Green&apos;s excellent work as director, the film is technically superb. The soundtrack and use of music is brilliant, and frequent Gordon Green collaborator Tim Orr&apos;s cinematography is consistently great. \n\n&quot;Pineapple Express&quot; will be an inherently divisive film. It didn&apos;t get the sort of critical accolades many previous Apatow clan movies did, and I expect audiences will also be a little less unanimous. Indeed, there&apos;s little of the critic-pleasing dramatic scenes Apatow&apos;s comedies have been praised for, and even when they do pop up they&apos;re usually deflated instantly with a joke, and credit has to go to director David Gordon Green for his expert handling of the film&apos;s tone, which never becomes schmaltzy, thank the heavens. Really, the whole film is throughly enjoyable except for the very last scene in the film, which contains one of the film&apos;s best jokes, but is really hard to buy given the state the characters are in, and also more than a little forced. Aside from that moment the whole thing works beautifully, quite astounding given the mesh of many different genres and sorts of comedy that this is. You either go with this movies sense of humor or you don&apos;t, and I imagine more people will enjoy the first three quarters of the movie, before the big, long action scene happens, and lots and lots of violence occurs. I guess you have to have a somewhat morbid sense of humor to laugh at ALL of the jokes in the film, but so what? There are also some nice little tongue-in-cheek references to the film&apos;s influences (&quot;they messed with the wrong melon farmers&quot;). \n\nThe cast really give it their all. It was great to see James Franco back in a comedic role, and his performance steals the show. Rogen is good as usual, Gary Cole is a perfect villain, and it&apos;s nice to see the gorgeous and talented Amber Heard finally make a quality film (and get one of the film&apos;s funniest scenes as her character&apos;s final scene). The supporting cast are also all good in their roles.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; won&apos;t work for many people, and they will probably end up being the very reasons the film works for those who like it. The film&apos;s plot is inherently silly to an extent (although this is nowhere near the &quot;Anchorman&quot; style of comedy), and one must be prepared for an outright comedy and not something in the vein of &quot;Knocked Up&quot;. &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; may end up being more enjoyable for stoners and those with friends who are stoners, but it works on its own as great comedy because the humor has much more range and scope than just marijuana. One of the best comedies in years.\n\n9/10"

            "reviewBody": "When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it&apos;s easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film&apos;s brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. \n\nIt&apos;s hard for an audience of this day and age to get into a period piece set in the 17th century without any big name actors or action elements. And I have to admit that I wasn&apos;t sure I wanted to see a film like this, especially with its horror elements. But my eyes were pealed from beginning to end. I wouldn&apos;t say anything about the story shocked me or had me confused, but the imagery, score, and uncompromising nature to Robert Egger&apos;s direction left me breathless. Within 10 minutes I was looking at the screen and whispering to myself &quot;why would you go there?&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t do that!&quot;, or &quot;come on, really?&quot;. Not because I thought it was poor story- telling, but because I was so invested as to what these characters were doing.\n\nWith that said, I don&apos;t think this film is for everyone. It&apos;s brutal, harshly relentless, and utterly disturbing. The characters use all 17th century dialogue and the cinematography sets this grey and ominous tone. The imagery from beginning to end will stick in your head as it has done with me. But that&apos;s the way horror films should be. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s more a psychological thriller because there are plenty of terrifying moments, but it is more for the &apos;Under the Skin&apos; crowd than it is for people who love &apos;The Conjuring&apos;. Even in its harsh moments, I was always invested and I can&apos;t deny the quality of the writing, directing, and acting all around. This is how you make a horror film.\n\n+Terrifying imagery\n\n+Egger&apos;s direction\n\n+Invested from beginning to end\n\n-Sometimes the dialogue is difficult to follow\n\n7.6/10",

There was a tension that you should feel throughout. And so many Performances with a capital P - ESP Ariana, Mike and David. The shots were absolutely BEAUTIFUL. The orchestra - EXQUISITE. This version of WSS actually broke me.\n\nI want to watch it again. I look forward to owning this version on DVD.",

Now look, I don&apos;t mind creators settling on common templates nor do I care if a certain film has been influenced by some Western features or not, instead, what I do expect though is an unambiguously penned narrative that can lay out the shenanigans of vengeance in a somewhat engrossing manner.\n\nFor a tale of comeuppance, it&apos;s rather imperative to have a commanding narrative as well as a set of constructive character developments. However, in this case, it had none! &quot;Thar&quot; might have had naive intentions in its heart but looking at the denouement, it has to be pointed out that their plans didn&apos;t go as intended.

The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add)...\n\nWe gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said &quot;Do you think there&apos;s any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?&quot; -- and thank God she replied, &quot;Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can&apos;t stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It&apos;s just terrible&quot;.\n\nWe got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked! \n\nI give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoor scenery! \n\nDon&apos;t waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it&apos;s worst.",

            "reviewBody": "I caught a sneak preview of Zombieland with a friend and was impressed to say the least.\n\nZombieland has to have one of the flashiest openings in memory. There is no subtle build up. You are dropped right into Zombieland as Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) begins listing the rules to survival. Of course each rule gives you a hysterical example of why the rule is in place. Anything that has been taboo for horror films at one time is met head on. I won&apos;t list each as not to spoil the movie but Zombieland has a unique ability to make almost anything seem comical. This includes the fact that for some reason it seems that every zombie in Zombieland has a blood belching problem. Literally every zombie has blood spewing from their mouth. This is captured best in the intro as you almost feel like you are supposed to have the 3D glasses in place.\n\nColumbus is funny enough with his phobias and geek lifestyle that proves to be what keeps him alive but it isn&apos;t until he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), that things really kick into gear. Harrelson seems to have been born for this role. He has more one liners than any character in recent memory. Each line is typically vulgar but even if offensive it is near impossible not to laugh. Let&apos;s face it, if you are completely offended by language or blood then you aren&apos;t likely to be sitting with a crowd watching Zombieland in the first place.\n\nA little romance is thrown into the mix when Columbus and Tallahassee come up on Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). For a zombie comedy I thought Eisenberg and Stone actually had decent chemistry. Not that much time is dedicated to romance but what is there comes across as sincere and lets us watch as Columbus transitions from geek to hero. Even without the romance the girls are an important part of the chemistry of Zombieland. They help to even out the brawn and the brains between the four characters.\n\nZombieland has a simple story. The guys are loners. Columbus with the simple mission to stay alive and Tallahassee with a never ending search for any and all of the remaining golden Twinkies left on the planet. The girls are sisters who are trying to get to an amusement park in CA where they believe, or at least want to believe it is zombie free. A small part of the film feels like the movie Vacation with zombies. The comical trip with a destination which you can just feel isn&apos;t going to be what the characters hope for. Like Vacation it shows that the journey is far more important than the destination.\n\nThe biggest moment of the film has to be the mystery cameo. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t know who it was and I won&apos;t spoil it for anyone else. I will say that it was brilliantly written into the script. PERFECT! It really goes to show how much they focused on getting Zombieland to be a top notch flick that should go down as a horror-comedy classic to remember. It will certainly fit alongside Shaun of the Dead in my movie collection.",

            "reviewBody": "This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie&apos;s work. Branagh&apos;s portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.\n\nA strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.\n\nThere were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile being the next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle, but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumbles upon them whenever he goes on vacation.",
